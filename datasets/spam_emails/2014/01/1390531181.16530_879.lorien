 cloud. The plant also had an unspecified 
amount of ammonium nitrate, a chemical that has been used in explosives, 
like in the Oklahoma City bombing.A spokeswoman for the Texas State Fire 
Marshal's office, which is investigating the explosion, said the anhydrous 
ammonia tanks stored at West Fertilizer at the time of the blast 
appeared to have no scorch marks or any sign that they were 
part of a blast that left a crater more than 90 feet 
wide.Officials have not ruled out the role of an intruder or other 
criminal activity being involved. Ten first responders and two people volunteering 
to help fight the initial fire died in the explosion.Matt Cawthon, the 
chief deputy sheriff in McLennan County, said in an interview Friday that 
anhydrous ammonia theft calls had declined in recent years, as had the 
number of meth labs authorities have busted as Mexican drug cartels are 
smuggling in more of the drug."The thefts ... and the reports for 
law enforcement assistance in that area, in my estimation, were minor and 
were petty," Cawthon said.There were no reports that ammonium nitrate had 
been stolen from the plant, Cawthon said."If ammonium nitrate had been stolen 
.. then that report would have generated probably a lot of attention," 
he said.Federal regulation of ammonium nitrate is largely focused on the 
safe storage of the chemical, for fear it will fall into the 
hands of criminals or terrorists. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
is resthe administration's corner-cutting on women's health," Baruch said. "It's 
a sad day for women's health when politics prevails."After the appeal was 
announced late Wednesday, Terry O'Neill, president of the National Organization 
for Women, said, "The prevention of unwanted pregnancy, particularly in 
adolescents, should not be obstructed by politicians." She called it a "step 
backwards for women's health."Last week, O'Neill noted, Obama was applauded 
when he addressed members of Planned Parenthood and spoke of the organization's 
"core principle" that women should be allowed to make their own decisions 
about their health."President Obama should practice what he preaches," O'Neill 
said.In appealing the ruling Wednesday, the administration recommitted itself 
to a position Obama took during his re-election campaign that younger teens 
shouldn't have unabated access to emergency contraceptives, despite the 
insistence by physicians groups and much of his Democratic base that the 
pill should be readily available.The Justice Department's appeal responded 
to an order by U.S. District Judge Edward Korman in New York 
that would allow girls and women of any age to buy not 
only Plan B but its cheaper generic competition as easily as they 
can buy aspirin. Korman gave the FDA 30 days to comply, and 
the Monday deadline was approaching.In its filing, the Justice Department 
said Korman exceeded his authority and that his decision should be suspended 
while  that does not mean he 
will not pay a price for it.And Now, A Word From Charles"If 
it turns out there are people who were material witnesses [concerning the 
attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya] who could have known 
stuff who were turned away -- rather than perhaps ignored or negligence 
involved -- but if there was active turning away as a way 
to protect the administration, then you have a scandal on your hands."-- 
Charles Krauthammer on "Special Report with Bret Baier."Chris Stirewalt
