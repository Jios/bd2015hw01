bique."Their legal system is 
far from adequate and an individual found guilty is given a slap 
on the wrist and then they say 'OK. Give me my horn 
back,'" said Michael H. Knight, chairman of the African Rhino Specialist 
Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Species 
Survival Commission.A meeting of the group in February reported there might, 
possibly, be one white rhino left in Mozambique and no black rhinos 
at all, Knight said.According to Abacar: "We have already announced the 
extinction of the rhino population in Limpopo National Park."But Bartolomeu 
Soto, director of Mozambique's transfrontier conservation unit, told the 
AP "We believe we still have rhinos, though we don't know how 
many."Mozambican news reports have said the last 15 rhinos in the park 
were slaughtered in the past month, but park officials said those reports 
were wrong. Soto said the misunderstanding had arisen over Abacar's statement 
to journalists that he had not seen a rhino in the three 
months since he was put in charge of the large park.The only 
official figure available for rhino deaths is that 17 rhino carcasses were 
found in the park in 2010, Soto said. He said officials believe 
poaching must be taking place because rhino horn and elephant tusks carried 
by Asian smugglers are regularly seized at Mozambique's ports, although 
at least some of the contraband could be from animals killed by 
Mozambican poachers in neighboring South Afriifle used 
to shoot at the White House at a "desolate crater" outside his 
home in Idaho Falls, prosecutors said in the document. They said a 
witness told them Ortega-Hernandez practiced shooting at items including 
"a home stereo amplifier, an empty ammunition case, a video cassette recorder, 
and a stereo speaker."Ortega-Hernandez fired the assault weapon from his 
car, a black Honda Accord, and then fled on foot after he 
crashed it, prosecutors said. They said he was later photographed riding 
on a freight train headed northwest from Washington. A former FBI photographer 
who takes pictures of trains as a hobby took the picture and 
approached law enforcement with it, the document said.Ortega-Hernandez, 
who was arrested in Pennsylvania several days after the shooting, told investigators 
his car was stolen from him at gunpoint the same day as 
the shooting.A status conference in the case is set for June 18.Shown here are images released by the FBI of people wanted for 
questioning in connection with the Benghazi attack.FBIWhite House Press 
Secretary Jay Carney, deflecting criticism over the Libya terror attack, 
argued Wednesday that "Benghazi happened a long time ago."But despite the 
nearly eight months that have elapsed since then, the FBI is only 
now producing photos of individuals they'd like to bring in for questioning.The 
release of the grainy images comes as the House plans another Benghazi 
hearing next week. It also comes after Fox News reported that U.S. 
officials have identified the mastermind of the attack, who according to 
sources is walking free in Libya.Coincidence? Yes, according to the FBI.An 
FBI spokesman said the bureau had long been moving toward publishing the 
images, and denied any connection between recent media coverage of Benghazi 
and the release."Our plan to publicize these photos was in the works 
for weeks," the spokesman said.It's unclear how long the bureau had the 
images, and whether it kept them private for investigative reasons.No names 
were given in connection with the individuals shown in the latest pictures. 
In its statement, the FBI claimed the individuals were at the U.S. 
compound when it was attacked on Sept. 11."We are seeking information about 
three individuals who were on the grounds of the U.S. Special Mission 
when it was attacked," the FBI said in the statement. "These individuals
