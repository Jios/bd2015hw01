is some twisted stuff
going on in their brains that they don't even like to admit to themselves.

<title>The New York Times (NYT) is an American daily newspaper, founded and continuously published in New York City since September 18, 1851. It has won 112 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other news organization.[3][4] Its website is one of America's most popular news sites, and the most popular among all the nation's newspapers, receiving more than 30 million unique visitors per month as reported in January 2011.[5]
The paper's print version remains the largest local metropolitan newspaper in the United States and third-largest newspaper overall, behind The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. Following industry trends, its weekday circulation has fallen to fewer than one million daily since 1990.[6] Nicknamed The Gray Lady, The Times is long regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record".[7] It is owned by The New York Times Company. The company's chairman is Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., whose family has controlled the paper since 1896.[8] Its international version, formerly the International Herald Tribune, is now called the International New York Times.
The paper's motto, "All the News That's Fit to Print", appears in the upper left-hand corner of the front page. Its website has adapted it to "All the News That's Fit to Click".[9] It is organized into sections: News, Opinions, Business, Arts, Science, Sports, Style, Home, and Features. The New York Times stayed with the eight-column format for several years after most papers switched to six, and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography.</title>
