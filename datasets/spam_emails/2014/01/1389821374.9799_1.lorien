Please note - The life-span of an activation code is 21 days; after this time, the activation code will expire and a new one must be ordered.  

Please be aware when choosing a new pin and password for the service, it is important not to use pin/passwords that you have used before but to use completely different details.

If you are the sole Administrator may I take this opportunity to suggest when you are reinstated on the system, to set up another User in an Administrator role. This will prevent you being locked out completely and allow you to order a new activation code from within the system and reset your security sooner.

If you require any further assistance then please do not hesitate to contact us on 0845 300 4108 and one of our associates will be happy to assist you.
