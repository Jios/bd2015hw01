Personal Greetings to you as i write to introduce myself properly since we =
have not met or had any contact before. I am Ms. Zeinah Mansour from Zamalk=
a Town in Southern Syria, the wife of Late Dr. Aboulafia Mansour, an Oil Me=
rchant that lost his life in the August 21st 2013 Chemical Attack in Syria =
by the Bashar al-Assad regime. When my late husband was alive, he deposited=
 the sum of U$28,200,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Two Hundred Thousand Uni=
ted State Dollars) with one Investment House in Western Europe as a bulk se=
curity deposit due to the anticipated civil war in Syria. The funds are par=
t of his Capital from his oil Trading Businesses and the funds are still pr=
esently with this Financial Firm. Recently my Doctor told me that I might n=
ot last for another three months or thereabout due to the damages on my Lun=
gs and Central nervous system which was as a result of my direct exposure t=
o the same deadly Sarin Gas that was used in the said Chemical Attack.

Having known my condition and since my Kids are still infants, I have decid=
ed to look for a Godly person like you that will help my kids invest the fu=
nds until there are of age to take procession of it. I also want you to inv=
est the funds in a risk free or minimum risk venture of high turnover. I to=
ok this decision because my late husband relatives are people of questionab=
le characters and they might even kill me and my kids should they find out =
about the security deposit. You will be rewarded with 50% of whatsoever pro=
fit that come out of the business venture and further agreed percentage fro=
m the original funds as a good will gesture for accepting my proposal.

As soon as I receive your positive reply with your full contact details lik=
e Full Names, Residential Address, Telephone Number and copy of any of your=
 identity proof, I shall give same to my lawyer that will prepare the neces=
sary documentations from a competent Court that will present you as my legi=
timate Next of Kin to the deposited Fund. Any delay or none response on you=
r part will give me room in sourcing for another individual for this same p=
urpose. Do remember U$28,200,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Two Hundred Thou=
sand United State Dollars) is a huge amount hence i will appreciate you con=
sider my proposal because i don't want my kids to loose the funds in the ca=
se of my death.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord, as I hope to have a positive respon=
se from you.

Yours in Christ
Ms. Zeinah Mansour.
