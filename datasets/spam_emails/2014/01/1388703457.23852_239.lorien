Greeting to you my dear friend.

I am Mr. James Daniel; I'm a citizen in USA and 48 years Old. I reside here in Florida. I am one of those that executed Compensation in Africa, many years ago and they refused to pay me; I had paid over $40,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to No avail. So I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my compensation documents, and I was directed to meet Prof. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, who is the member of COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, and I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.

He took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest man on earth because I have received my Compensation funds of $800,000.00 which i will use in celebrate my X-max and New year Moreover, Prof. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, showed me the Full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your Name with a reference to File No: 1509/UBN/FMF/2013,a draft of $2,800,000.00 United States Dollars was approved in your name by the present Government as one of the beneficiary, and your email address, that is why I Decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with Your funds, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Prof. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi.

You have to contact him direct on this information below.

Prof. Sanusi Lamido Sanusi COMPENSATION HOUSE
