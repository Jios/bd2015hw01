H more, that there should be some to prepare the way before his second. And=
 so it is expressed in the collect for the third Sunday in Advent: "O Lord =
Jesus Christ, who at thy first coming didst send thy messenger to prepare t=
hy way before thee; grant that the ministers and stewards of thy mysteries =
may likewise so prepare and make ready thy way, by turning the hearts of th=
e disobedient to the wisdom of the just, that at thy second coming to judge=
 the world we may be found an acceptable people in thy sight, who livest an=
d reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit, ever one God, world without=
 end. Amen." NOW, in what does this preparing for him consist; and what is =
its object? The Scripture will inform us as to both. The object is, "Lest h=
e come and smite the earth with a curse;" lest, when he shall come, his com=
ing, which should be our greatest joy and happiness, should be our everlast=
ing destruction; for there can abide before him nothing that is evil. This =
is the object of preparing for Christ's coming. Next, in what does the prep=
aration consist? It consists in teaching men to live above the common notio=
ns of their age and country; to raise their standard higher; to live after =
what is right in God's judgment, which often casts away, as faulty and bad,=
 what men were accustomed to think good. And as the people of Israel, altho=
ugh they had God's revelation among them, had yet let their standard of goo=
d and evil become low, even so it has been in the Christian Israel. We have=
 God's will in our hands, yet our judgments are not formed upon it; and, th=
erefore, they who would prepare us for Christ's coming, must set before us =
a commandment which is new, although old: in one sense old, in every genera=
tion, inasmuch as it is the same which we had from the beginning; in anothe=
r sense, in every generation more new, inasmuch, as the habits opposed to i=
t have become the more confirmed; and the longer the night has lasted, the =
more strange to our eyes is the burst of the returning light. But when we t=
hus speak of the common notions of our age and country being deficient, and=
 thus, in effect, commend notions which would be singular, do we not hold a=
 language inconsistent with our common language and practice? Do we not com=
monly regard singularity as a fault, and attach a considerable authority to=
 the consent of men in general? Nay, do we not often appe
