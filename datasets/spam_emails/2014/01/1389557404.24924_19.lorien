Dear Sir,

I am a marketing consultant with operational base in South Africa and West Africa.

My client (a wealthy Libyan citizen) is interested in establishing foreign partnership through which he can invest idle funds. He is interested in construction/real estates and, or, any other lucrative business of choice in your county.

Are you capable of receiving and managing huge funds? If your answer is on the affirmative, and  you are interested, please get in touch for further discussion bordering on expansion and funding.

Thanks

Mr. Agyeman Apiah
