Dear Friend,

I am Hamza Bollinga an African woman who likes nature and love life and later on i married a man i loved so much but because my husband was a son of a king in Ghana and after his father died my husbands brothers killed him because he was the first son and they believe after the death of the king my husband will be the next king because they were jealous of him, so they thought the best way to do is to kill him because he will be the next to rule the kingdom.

Now my husband is dead and left some inheritance of 1000kg of AU Gold for me which i cannot go and claim because of the family, but his family members do not want to set their eyes on me otherwise they will kill me and my 2 kids, as they chased me from the house after the death of my late husband. I need you to help me claim this inheritance from the finance house so that i can relocate from this country and invest with my inheritance. Please get back to me via my email address with your complete contact details if you can help me and i am willing to split my inheritance with you with what you want me to give you after our discussion My email is ( 1594359829@qq.com )

Thanks and God bless you for your help.

Regards,
Mrs Hamza Bollinga
