<p align="center">two years. But they were too methodical. That’s why they lost the  war.   They  were  too methodical. They’d fire their guns every ten minutes — regular. Think of  it.   Of  course  YQH </p>

we knew when to run, and when to lie down. You got so that you knew  almost  exactly  what they’d do — if you’d been out long enough. And then you could  time  what  you  wanted  f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 to </p>

burst in the air like electric light — we had none of that f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 to do —  they  did  it  all  for us — lit up everything. They were more nervous than f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 we f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 were. . . .” </p>

It was nearly f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 two UOSCVRFXK <i>o’clock  when  Herbertson  left.   Lilly, depressed, remained before the fire. Aaron got out</i>of bed and came uneasily  to  the  fire. </p>

<p>“It gives me the bellyache,  that  damned  war, ”  he  said. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 “So  it  does  me, ”  said  Lilly.     OOOLGQYO   “All    unreal.   ” “Real f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047  enough  for  those  that  had  to  go  through  it. ” </p>
<BR><BR><span style="font-family: Tahoma, Courier New, Times New Roman, Arial; font-size: 9px;"></span>
<p>
“No, least of all for them,” said Lilly sullenly.   “Not  as real as IHPQ a bad dream. Why the hell   don’t    they    wake    up    and    realise    it!” </p>

“That’s a fact,” said Aaron. “They’re  hypnotised f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047  by  it. ” “And  they  want  to  hypnotise  me.

“Yes you QUAO can. It never happened. It never  happened  to  me. No more than my dreams happen. My   dreams    don’t    happen:    they    only    seem.   ” </p>

<p align="left">
“But the war  did  happen,   OHMBWC right  enough, ”  smiled  Aaron palely. “No, it didn’t. Not to me or to any man, in  his  own  self. It took place in the automatic </p>

<p>“You tell ’em so,” said Aaron. “I do. But KWKB it’s no good. Because  they  won’t  wake  up  now even — perhaps never. They’ll all kill themselves in their sleep.” </p>

“They wouldn’t<b>be any better if they  did  wake  up  and  be themselves — that is, supposing they</b>are asleep, which I can’t  see.   They  are  TFWSIYWI what  they </p>

<p>slowly. “I don’t even want to believe in them.” “But in yourself?” Lilly was<u> almost  wistful  —  and  Aaron uneasy. “I don’t know  that f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047  I’ve  any  more  right  to</u> believe  in </p>

<p align="right">always knew it was false. The Germans were false,   we  were false, everybody was false.” “And not you?” asked JJJA Aaron shrewishly. “There was a wakeful, self-possessed bit of  me  which  knew </p>

that the war and all that horrible movement was false for me. And so  I  wasn’t f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047  going to be dragged in. The Germans could have shot my mother  or  me  or  what  they  VGLY liked:  I .</p>
