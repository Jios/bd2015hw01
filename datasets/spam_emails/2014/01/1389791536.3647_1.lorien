Compliments,

This is the second time I am contacting you in this project. I have a Benefiting Business transaction worth of 
millions of dollars which requires you to act as a Co-investor Partner to a diseased investor client from 
ExxonMobil Oil and Gas, where I work as an Audit Accountant. Can you handle this project and can I trust you 
in this?

If you can handle this transaction, then signify your interest by providing your full names, private contact 
number and email for more details.

Best Regards,
Mr. Steven Tiano
