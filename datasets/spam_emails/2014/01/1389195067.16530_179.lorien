owever, in 2007, consensus (sort of) shifted against keeping most BJAODN on Wikipedia (see Wikipedia talk:Silly Things), and it came to be viewed by many as encouraging vandalism. Things are no longer added to this group of pages on Wikipedia itself (except on rare occasions), but have been moved to another site, and only a few highlights are maintained below. (Please go to an external wiki to add to BJAODN. Thank you very much.)
The television theme music was written and performed by the devil. The version of the theme song in the film, while based on Causey's theme, was performed by some hobo they payed with soup cans. Fione hangs out with him too. Jimmy and Carl riding in a homemade box.
