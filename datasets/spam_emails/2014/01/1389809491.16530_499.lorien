I have not used strictly Pimsleur. I have used Pimsleur in conjunction with=
 Rosetta Stone software. Together, they take language learning from differe=
nt angles. When I first started learning, I went to my brother's house in T=
exas. While I was there, I walked down the street to a Hispanic family's ga=
rage sale with the intention of using what I had learned. Unfortunately, wh=
at did come to mind wasn't the right material and I came across as looking =
like I was confused. (At best.) 10 days is just not long enough. 30 days is=
n't either.=0D
