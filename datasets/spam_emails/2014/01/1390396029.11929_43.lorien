Dear beloved.

I am Mrs Lilian Peter from Europe. I am married to Mr.Carlos Mc Callum who worked with our Embassy in Spain for Eight years before he died in the 29 DECEMBER 2011. We were married for eleven years without a child.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only 3 days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late husband was a life he made a deposit of a trunk box containing some liquid amount of money in a security custody in London, though he did not deposit that box as money rather he deposited it as church equipment.

Presently this trunk box is still in the custody of the security custody in London while i myself is in Spain.Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 2 months due to the deadly cancer that attacked my kidney and also for almost 2 years now i can not take a walk because my 2 legs are paralyzed as well. Having known my condition of health I decided to donate this fund to a church,organization or good person that will utilize this money to help the needy and also propagate the word of God and maintained the house of God.

The Bible made us to understand that " Blessed is the hand that giveth ". l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are very devilish not even good at all because they are the one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband properties and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.

This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know 
that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace".

I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about This development and I know that With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall direct you on what to do next.

In conclusion, I want you and your organisation to always pray for me because the lord is my only shepherd.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.

Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life.Contact me on the this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in finding another good person for this same purpose.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.Hoping to receive your response immediately.

Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.

I remain yours sister in Christ.

Mrs Lilian Peter
