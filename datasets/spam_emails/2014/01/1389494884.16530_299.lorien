Hello, all,

I believe my next message will be that Aunt Agatha has gone Home. She
slept peacefully and seemingly without pain all day except when I
moistened her lips and tongue, and when we changed her position in bed.
She didn't smile or say anything but would follow us with her eyes and
squeeze my hand when I held it. When we changed her pad and repositioned
her again at 9:00 PM she hardly even opened her eyes. Neither did she
respond when I prayed and sang with her a bit later, and put lip
moisturizer on her lips inside and out, as well as on her tongue.

Before I went home, I went through a few things to prepare clothes for
her, etc. I accidentally banged the metal closet door. A big noise! No
response. I am just praising God that she gave me such a clear statement
of faith in the finished work of Christ on the cross. What a glory and
wonder awaits all who believe. She will soon experience that! If she
could, she would say "Hallelujah!"   AMEN! Pray the Lord will take her soon.

Good night,

Betty
