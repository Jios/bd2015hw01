Dear Friend,

How are you today? I hope all is well with you and your family.

Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you,but this particular
letter is of exceptional and very private nature.

My name is Afaafa Adhra GBAGBO,second wife to former Cote d'Ivoire
President,Mr.Laurent GBAGBO.I am resident in Abidjan,Cote d'Ivoire.I
am a 45 years old woman with three children, I am a devoted christian.

Sequel to the arrest of my husband by the opposition fighters with the
help of French army and his consequent transfer to the United Nations
Court of Justice headquarters in Hague,Netherlands  for trial for  his
role in the bloody election crises that followed after the 2011
election in Cote d'Ivoire.I am afraid that the hit might soon turn on
us (his immediate relatives) in the event that he is convicted as his
trial has started in Hague.

I therefore urgently want to acquire a property (HOUSE) as I wish to
relocate my children out of this country for safety and also to start
a
new life before this present turn around of event affects the future
of my children and I. My choice of property are duplex houses with
about four or
five bedrooms in a very peaceful and quiet city.The prices of which I
expect to range between US$500,000.00 to USD$3,000,000 .

The mode of payment will not able a problem for I am paying you cash.
PLEASE CAN I TRUST AND CONFIDE IN YOU? The political situation in my
country as it affects my husband's immediate family  and the present
happenings concerning my husband has taken a different toll as many
former aides to my husband are still being killed silently and i do
not think my children and I are safe here.

Due to security reasons, I will not be able to call you and you can
not call me too as our telephone lines were being bugged so I was
advised by one of my husband former aides to disconnect out phone
lines for security reasons.

Please contact me as soon as possible via my alternative email
address:gbagboafaafa1@yahoo.co.uk

Best regards


Mrs.Afaafa Adhra Gbagbo
