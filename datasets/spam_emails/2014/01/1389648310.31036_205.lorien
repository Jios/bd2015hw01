Hello  Dear,

How are you my dear,my name is Mr.Bruno Morgan  from UK London,I work
with one of the Banks here in England. My dear I want you to keep this
mail very secret as I would not like any member of our staff to hear
about it.

I am contacting you base on one of our late customer,Mr Wang Fat Wu
from CHINA who was an international cured oil dealer. He died last two
years in his home town in a car accident. Before his death, he has the
sum of =A325 Million Pounds here in my branch and I happened to be his
account officer. My dear I want you to stand as his next of kin so
that my bank will transfer this money into your bank account in your
Country.

I have all the whole powers to present you as the Next of kin if you
can be able to work with me. Let hear from you as soon as you get this
mail, so that we can further ahead for this transaction it will only
take few banking days to get this money transfer into your account.

Contact me on my private Email (brunohu@yahoo.com.ph) if you are ready
to do this deal.

Your's faithfully,

Mr.Bruno Morgan
