From Mrs Abina 


Dearest in Christ Jesus,


My name is Mrs.Abina  a nationality of Kuwait. I was married to late Mr. Gaman  who worked with Kuwait embassy here in GHANA for nine years before he died in the year October 2011. We were married for twenty years with a child. My husband died after an illness that lasted for four days may his Soul rest in perfect peace Amen.

Before his death we were both born again Christians. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of (eleven million us dollars) with one of good banks here in GHANA presently, this money is still with the bank. Recently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problem, though what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here in. more especially earthquake victims in Haiti and also any organization of your choice, the poor and the motherless babies. I want a person or church that will use this fund to churches, orphanages, research centers and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.


The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I have a child that will inherit this money but my son can not carryout this work only because I and my late husband decide to use some of the money to work for God and live some for our son to have a better live. our son is just 17year old now, and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I don't want my family hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers, I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus! 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I will like you to understand that my contact to you is a divine direction from God, I don't want any of my husband family relatives to receive this money but I know that With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your 
 reply I shall give you the contac


Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.


Yours Sister in Christ

Mrs.Abina  And Son .
