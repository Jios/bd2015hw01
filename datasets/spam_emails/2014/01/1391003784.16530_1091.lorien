cate people and it is a way that people can learn 
about different peoples lifestyles and different peoples jobs. Not every 
show does that. Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, some can argue that 
its just kind of garbage for your mind but entertaining Reality TV 
is really serving a lot of purposes these days said Cascerceri.Meyer was 
less optimistic about the genre. He said he was unsure how long 
reality shows would stick around.I think that reality TV is kind of 
people stumbling around in the dark and sometimes they find something that 
blasts off, no one really knows why but because its a very 
fast moving business Maybe the next big hit is already here.Diana Falzone

Education," distributed in universities across North America.You can follow 
her on Twitter @dianafalzone.hite House Press Secretary Jay 
Carney said Biden continues to play a leading role in the gun 
control effort. He reiterated that the administration would continue to 
press for legislation and suggested lawmakers who opposed the last version 
would feel public pressure."In the end, senators who voted against the overwhelming 
will of their constituents may reconsider if they hear from those same 
constituents and hear how important these common-sense measures are to them," 
he said.The Obama-supporting Organizing for Action is working hard on the 
sidelines to apply that pressure. That group's home page, as of Friday 
afternoon, featured a sign-up for a petition supporting legislation.The 
lead post on the page claimed that poll numbers for lawmakers who 
opposed the legislation last month have dropped."Want proof that what OFA 
volunteers are doing is working? The senators who voted against expanding 
background checks are getting their poll numbers back since that vote-and 
they're not subtle," OFA claimed.But even Sen. Pat Toomey, who was a 
critical supporter of the compromise amendment that ultimately failed last 
month, claims Congress does not have the stomach for gun legislation any 
time soon.The Pennsylvania Republican had teamed up with moderate West Virginia 
Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin to offer the background check amendment, which 
would have expanded checks to gun shows and Internet sales while exempting 
family and other personal transactiKeith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Randy Jackson and Mariah Carey are shown on 
"American Idol" on April, 24, 2013.FOXKeith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Randy Jackson 
and Mariah Carey appear on "American Idol."APNicki Minaj and Mariah Carey's 
feud is far from over. A day after getting into a heated 
argument with Carey on "American Idol," Minaj tweeted a serious of insults 
at her fellow judge, referencing a recent report that said "Idol" producers 
considered replacing Carey with Jennifer Lopez.On Wednesday's "Idol," Minaj 
disagreed with Carey's critique of contestant Angie Miller, provoking the 
singer to snap about how Minaj has never had a No. 1 
single on the Billboard Hot 100.Check out the biggest celebrity feudsOn 
Thursday, Minaj tweeted: "All dem #1s but JLo phone ringin? Lol. I 
guess having a personality, being a secure woman, and giving genuine critique 
still trumps that." She continued: "What u SHOULD be doing (wit your 
messy a--) is asking why a woman SO successful at her age, 
is still so INSECURE, and bitter."Carey did not respond to Minaj's tweets, 
and the two kept their usually chilly distance on Thursday's show.Click
