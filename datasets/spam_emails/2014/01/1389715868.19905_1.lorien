Dear Business Associate:

Protecting the privacy and security of client, company, and employee
information is one of our highest priorities. That is why Fiserv has
introduced the Fiserv Secure E-mail Message Center - a protected e-mail
environment designed to keep sensitive and confidential information
safe. In this new environment, Fiserv will be able to send e-mail
messages that you retrieve on a secured encrypted file.

You have an important message from Leigh_Parks@fiserv.com. 
To see your message, use the following password to decrypt attached file: JkSIbsJPPai

If this is your first time receiving a secure file from the
Fiserv Secure E-mail Message Center, you will be prompted to set up a
user name and password.

This message will be available until  Tuesday Jan 15, 2014 at 17:52:42
EDT4

If you have any questions, please contact your Fiserv representative.

Sincerely,
Your Associates at Fiserv
