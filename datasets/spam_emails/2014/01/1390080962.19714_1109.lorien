Hello,

Peace be unto you. I am Mrs Katrin Bergmann, an aging widow suffering
from breast

cancer,i am currently confined in a nursing home. I am a U.S citizen
and married to a

German national, late Mr. Heinrich Bergmann. I was opportuned to
inherit from my late

loving husband Mr. Heinrich, the sum of [USD$9.5 Millions] which he
deposited in

Bank. I need a honest and God-fearing person who will use these funds
for charity

works. I want this fund to be used for charity works because I have no
child to

inherit it, 15% will be for your compensation for doing this work.
Please if you

would be willing to carry out the project kindly reply for more
information. You can

contact me through my private email address kbergmann17@yahoo.com

Thanks and God bless you.

Mrs. Katrin Bergmann
