I have not used strictly Pimsleur. I have used Pimsleur in conjunction with=
 Rosetta Stone software. Together, they take language learning from differe=
nt angles. When I first started learning, I went to my brother's house in T=
exas. While I was there, I walked down the street to a Hispanic family's ga=
rage sale with the intention of using what I had learned. Unfortunately, wh=
at did come to mind wasn't the right material and I came across as looking =
like I was confused. (At best.) 10 days is just not long enough. 30 days is=
n't either.=0D

 isn't either. im sorry 2 say but it doesnt teach u a language in 10 days..=

y problem is that u dont learn how 2 write or read the language...its jsut =
conversational stuff really, but thats good if ur just goin on hol. if u wa=
nt more, u will hav 2 invest in another language learnin thing aswell coz t=
his wont teach u everyfin. but im 100% sure that if u do this course, and d=
ont loose ur attention 2 easily u will feel really confident with havin a c=
onversation as u will be able 2 understand and talk the basics rally well. =
