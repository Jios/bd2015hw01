Hello

I am inspired to send you this email by the huge opportunity that it will b=
e of mutual benefit to us.My late client a national of Israel a Man who use=
d to work with Shell before his untimely death few years ago and inquiries =
to several embassies to locate any of my clients extended relatives proved =
abortive.I decide to trace his relatives over the Internet . Still no succe=
ss.

Hence,this contact to you.I contacted you only to assist in repatriating th=
e sum involved otherwise the estate he left behind will be declared unservi=
ceable by the bank which just issued me a notice to provide the next of kin=
 or have the account frozen.I now use this medium to seek your consent so t=
hat the proceeds can be paid to you since I have all the necessary legal do=
cuments to back up our claim.

I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement t=
hat will protect you and I from any breach of the law.All I require is your=
 honest cooperation to enable us redeem the funds.

Kindly reply back if this proposal satisfies your interest.

Steven Mark.
