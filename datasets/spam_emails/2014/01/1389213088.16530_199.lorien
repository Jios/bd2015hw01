 shut them up in a madhouse: yet if madmen wore to insist that they were sa=
ne, and that we were mad, I know not to what infallible authority we could =
appeal; and, after all, what are we to do with those who deny that authorit=
y to be infallible? we must then go to another infallible authority to guar=
antee the infallibility of the first, and this process will run on for ever=
 But, in truth, there is more in the matter than the being justified or no=

I imagine, with many good and thinking men is this: whether a reasonable be=
