Mrs.Achima Bachmeier,
Stuttgart, Germany.

Greeting to you in the name of our God almighty,

I am the above named person from Stuttgart, Germany I am married to Mr. Andrew Bachmeier who was an Oil Consultant/ Contractor with America National Petroleum Corporation America for nine years before he died in the year 2004, We were married for eleven years without a child.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death, we were both born again Christian and we worship in Glourios Chapel Church of God. Since his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the words is against.

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US$8.5 Million (United States Dollars) with CITIBANK in USA Presently,the fund is still with the bank. Recently, my Doctor Dr. Mrs Lina Diabate told me that i have terminal illness, Hepatocellular Carcinoma (Liver Cancer). The one that disturbs me most is my stroke sickness but I pray to God to heal me so that I will be alive and see his work done as my late husband instructed me.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church, individual or Organization that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein, I want somebody that will use this fund for orphanages, widows, propagating the word of God and to endeavor that the house of God is maintained, The words of God made us to understand that blessed is the hand that giveth.

I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not good to me and I don't want my husband efforts to be used by unbelievers,I dont want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way,This is why I am taking this decision,I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going,I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord.

Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband relatives around me always,I don't want them to know about this development, With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank and our family lawyer to communicate with them and claim the donation of the funds by all means and power.

I want you to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another church or individual or mosque for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.

Hoping to receive your reply for more details and please always put me in prayer so that our good God will pro-long my life untill I am able to see that this money gets to you.

Please write back to this email address for quick response: achimabachmeier032@e-mail.ua

Remain blessed in God.

Mrs.Achima Bachmeier.
