m police and store employees, Hurtado collected 
rope and rags from store shelves and put makeshift tourniquets on both 
arms, most likely saving the man's life, police said."Were we in a 
good place for it? No, but you improvise," Hurtado said. "If I 
didn't have rope I'd have used my shoelaces. We would have made 
it work."The man was in surgery hours after the incident, said Spl. 
Rudy Lopez, from the West Covina police. He knew nothing more of 
the mans condition.The man, who looked to be in his 40s, was 
carrying no identification, has been unable to answer questions, and was 
not heard saying anything in the store, so police do not know 
his name or why he cut himself, Lopez said.Police interviewed about five 
people who said they saw what happened, and Lopez said there were 
likely many more who quickly left the disturbing scene."It was pretty graphic," 
he said. The store was shut down the rest of the day.Click

banking crisis in Cyprus pushed depositors there to find creative ways to 
move money. Fink, the Argentine, favors bitcoins because he believes they 
will insulate him from his country's high inflation. Others -- from Iranian 
musicians to American auto dealers -- use the currency to dodge international 
sanctions or reach new markets.But the anything-goes nature of Bitcoin has 
also made it attractive to denizens of the Internet's dark side.One of 
the most prominent destinations for bitcoins remains Silk Road, a black 
market website where drug dealers advertise their wares in a consumer-friendly 
atmosphere redolent of Amazon or eBay -- complete with a shopping cart 
icon, a five-point rating system and voluminous user reviews. The site uses 
Tor, an online anonymity network, to mask the location of its servers, 
while bitcoin payments ensure there's no paper trail.One British user told 
the AP he first got interested in Silk Road while he was 
working in China, where he used the site to order banned books. 
After moving to Japan, he turned to the site for an occasional 
high."Buying recreational drugs in Japan is difficult, especially if you 
don't know people from growing up there," said the user, who asked 
for anonymity because he did not want his connection to Silk Road 
to be publicly known.He warned that one of the site's drawbacks is 
that the drugs can take weeks to arrive "so there's no spontaneity."Drug

Pendleton who was shot and killed on the south side of Chicago 
earlier this year, during a luncheon at the Chicago Hilton in Chicago.APCHICAGO 
 First lady Michelle Obama made a deeply personal entrance into the 
gun debate Wednesday, the eve of a showdown in Congress, by comparing 
herself to the honor student from her hometown killed by gun violence 
a week after performing in the presidential inaugural events.Mrs. Obama 
told a conference on youth violence that the new gun regulations her 
husband proposed in response to Connecticut's Sandy Hook Elementary School 
shooting deserve a vote in Congress. But she says reducing daily gun 
deaths in places like Chicago also will require an intensive effort by 
community leaders.As part of a rare foray into a policy debate, Mrs. 
Obama highlighted the case of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, shot to death 
in January while hanging out with friends at a park on the 
city's South Side, not far from the Obamas' home. Mrs. Obama attended 
Pendleton's funeral and said she was struck by how familiar the Pendleton 
family seemed to her own."Hadiya Pendleton was me and I was her," 
Mrs. Obama said. "But I got to grow up and go to 
Princeton and Harvard Law School and have a career and a family 
and the most blessed life I could ever imagine."She said the only
