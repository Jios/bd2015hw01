Good  Morning,
 
I need an experienced person to assist me to set up a  Tourist Hotel or Real Estate in your country, develop the project. On
the resumption of the project, you will be made a Director for the role and the assistance you rendered. I am sorry if this
is not in line with your business. You will also be entitled to a percentage agreed upon between me  and you before the
commencement of the project.
Your immediate reply will be highly appreciated and I shall give you more information on this project.
 
  Thanks and God
bless.
Don  Peterson
