My wife and I decided to donate the sum of $2,000,000,00 USD to you as part=
 of our charity project to improve the lot of 10 lucky individuals all over=
 the world from our $12 Billion Usd I and My Wife Mapped out to help people=

ecause i saw your profile on Microsoft email owners list and picked you. Su=
san my wife and i have decided to make sure this is put on the internet for=
 the world to see. my wife has cancer and she died at colchester regional h=
ospital, my wife just didn't die but she was a great person and I miss her =
so much and this is why I have decided to do one thing i promised her forev=
er. as you could see from the webpage above, am not getting any younger and=
 you can imagine having no much time to live. although am a Billionaire inv=
estor and we have helped some charity organizations from our Fund.

You see after taken care of the needs of our immediate family members, Befo=
re she died we decided to donate the remaining of our Billions to other ind=
ividuals around the world in need, the local fire department, the red cross=
, Haiti, hospitals in truro where Susan underwent her cancer treatment, and=
 some other organizations in Asia and Europe that fight cancer, alzheimer's=
 and diabetes and the bulk of the funds deposited with our payout bank of t=
his charity donation. we have kept just 40% of the entire sum to our self f=
or the remaining days because i am sick and am writing you from hospital co=
mputer because i dont know when i will die. =
