"Spontaneous" was the word of the week.As Romney tried to find his 
feet on the subject, Republicans began to accuse Obama of laxity. How 
could the U.S. not be prepared for an attack on the anniversary 
of 9/11? How could the consulate in a city known to be 
a home to Islamist radicals be so poorly guarded? What was the

made similar, reasonable inquiries, Obama's campaign and administration 
dismissed such questions as biased, saying the few members of the press 
who pressed the subject were just doing Romney's handiwork.This allowed 
Obama to hold the line and prevent greater anxiety or anger in 
the electorate. The attack was spontaneous and partly the fault of American 
religious radicals, so please stop politicizing this tragedy.But then it 
was revealed that there was no riot, spontaneous or otherwise. It had 
been a planned, coordinated raid. Further, there had been growing warnings 
from the diplomatic team in Libya that trouble was brewing. And while 
Obama claimed that Al Qaeda was in tatters, the group seemed to

was the first woman among more than 30 instructors at Joint Base 
San Antonio-Lackland charged in what has turned into the military branch's 
worst sex scandal.She pleaded guilty Wednesday to having sex with a male 
airman in 2011, seeking to have a sexual relationship with another male
