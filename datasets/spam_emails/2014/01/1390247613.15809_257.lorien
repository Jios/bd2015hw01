HELLO,

We are  solicitors.In the

suspected fraudsters  in Africa region, in collaboration with the
present governments of Nigeria, Ghana, Cote D'Ivoire, Burkinafaso,England and South
Africa, the UN security operatives have so far arrested and prosecuted over 300
government and banking officials and arrest is still going on.

So far, the UN security operatives have also recovered about $5.1 Billion from
both cash and accounts. It is from the
address books of the arrested officials that your email address was recovered.

Right now, the United Nations (UN) and their Africa Union (AU) counterpart is
paying a $1,000,000.00 compensation to those whose emails addresses and other
personal data are recovered from these arrested officials, and also paying full
contract or inheritance and winning amounts to those with provable information
qualifying them as genuine contractors and beneficiaries of funds in the
affected African countries.

Which Category do you fall? Have you been getting emails for payments from these
countries? OR are you a legitimate contractor and fund beneficiary in any of the
affected African country?

Please, indicate clearly as you get back to me for proper guidelines and details
on how to receive this compensation OR your full payment.

Waiting.
