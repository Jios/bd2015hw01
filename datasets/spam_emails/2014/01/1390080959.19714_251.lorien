Hello Bgware
                                                                                    
Prestige - because we care.
If you contrast all the features of our watch and the real one, you will notice no dissimilarity apart from the price.
                                   
*************************************************************************************************
I ordered a ca-26 watch from you last week it already arrived. Let me say the watch is awesome, I couldn't believe my eyes it looks exactly like the real thing. Let me tell you many thanks and I would buy a lot more watches from you from now on.
Had rather not I
