 of us, those who the least like to pray, who have prayed with the least be=

r everlasting destruction, when all their seeking, and all their prayer, wi=
ll be as rejected by God, as, in part, it has been already. LECTURE XIII. *=

f, has made upon him as he viewed it from below and from above. In going up=
 it seemed so high, that we fancied, if we were once arrived at it, we shou=
