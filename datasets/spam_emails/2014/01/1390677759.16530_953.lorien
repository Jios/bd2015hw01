small;"> Yes, hair can be transplanted from one area of the s=
calp to another. The transplanting of the hair is not the issue. It is havi=
ng enough hair to redistribute to the bald/thinning areas. There are curren=
tly two widely used methods of harvesting the grafts. The older method, fol=
licular unit strip surgery, involves cutting a strip of hair from around th=
e sides and back of the head about 1/4&quot; by 9&quot; long. Then dissecti=
ng it into 1,2 and 3 hair grafts to transplant under a microscope. Of cours=
e the scalp in th area of th surgery has to be stapled together. The proble=
m comes with tighter scalps limiting strip surgeries and limiting the numbe=
r of grafts. Since the scalp is rejoined where the strip is extracted, the =
hair on the back/sides is as thick as ever and the transplanted top can nev=
er be as thick. The newer method is FUE(follicular unit extraction), also k=
now as the wood's technique. The 1,2 and 3 hair transplants are removed ind=
ividually over a large area of the back/sides, thinning the back/sides. The=
re is no problem with scalp tightness limiting grafts. Also, less invasive =
as there is no cutting with scalpels involved and no stapling of the scalp =
together. Only a topical anesthetic is used. FUE tends to be more expensive=
 than a strip surgery to harvest the grafts. There is a lot of information =
on the internet on both methods. The transplanting of the grafts is largely=
 the same. It is the way the grafts are harvested that differs. Hopefully, =
in the not too distant future, an unlimited supply of grafts to transplant =
will be able to be grown in a lab.okay so my parents just set up an alarm s=
ystem because they caught me sneaking out. my dad said that if the door ope=

he alarm system thingy i would have made it cause im guessing my mom just w=
ent to set the alarm system and saw that the window was open. so now i have=
 another window on the other side of the house. its in this little office t=
