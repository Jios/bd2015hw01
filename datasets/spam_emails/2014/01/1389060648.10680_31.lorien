<DIV>
<I>You are advised to read this Letter very carefully because every</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>paragraph explains what you need to know about the Release and</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Transfer of your due Funds.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>At this point, we wish to remind you to stop all further contact with</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>any person or person(s) whom is not recommended by this Ministry. Our</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Intelligence Monitoring Unit (I.M.U), Code of Conduct Bureau, Legal</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Unit and The Nigerian Police Force (N.P.F) have already apprehended</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>some of those suspects whom attempted to divert your Funds.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>You are advised to stop all further contact with some scammers you</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>have been dealing with, that have defrauded you of huge sums because</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>they are WANTED criminal suspects.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>As the honorable Minister of Nigeria, I work on behalf of the Paying</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Bank of Nigeria Keystone Bank (formerly Bank PHB)under the supervision of the</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>honorable President of The Federal Republic of Nigeria.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>We are glad to announce it to you today that the honorable President</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>of The Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Accountant General of the</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Federation have collectively Approved and signed the Order to Release</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>and Transfer being the certified documentation authorizing us (The</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Federal Ministry of Finance) to credit your nominated Bank Account..</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>A copy of the Order to Release and Transfer have been forwarded to our</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>international remittance department for the onward crediting of your</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Funds.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>In other words, we put it to you that we are ready to remit your said</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Funds into your nominated Bank Account because we have a 3-4 working</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>days time constrain to Pay-off each beneficiary short-listed to be</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Paid by this Ministry. Our Legal Unit have already reviewed your</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Payment Files and they have passed it on to my desk for me to Pay you</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>accordingly, so be rest assured that you will receive your due Funds</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>as soon as possible. Officially, you will receive your due Funds via</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>an "Electronic Wire Transfer" which will enable your Funds reflect in</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>your Nominated Bank Account within 48hrs after effect. This mode of</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Payment is defined as one of the best and safest mode to remit huge</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Funds internationally as it is absolutely different from the usual</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>swift transfer which takes longer time. Most Banks within the United</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>States of America, Europe and other developed countries operate with</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>the "Electronic Wire Transfer" for international transfers because it</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>is a recent innovation in the Banking industry.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Certainly we shall transfer your valued US$3,500,000:00 from the</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Sundry/Suspense Account of the Federal Government of Nigeria being the</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>official Account for international/foreign Payments/debts. A</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Sundry/Suspense Account can be defined as a secret Account owned by a</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>government and operated by certain assigned government officials being</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>the authorized signatories whom must sign before Funds can be remitted</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>from such account. For this very account no form of direct withdrawals</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>can be made from it except a Bank to Bank wire transfer which must be</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Approved by the honorable President being the principal signatory to</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>the account.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>Consequent to the fact that I am responsible to Pay you, it is still</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>my duty to enlighten you on the accurate steps to take in order for</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>you to gain full possession of this said Funds being Approved in your</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>name.</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>In the combat against fraud, Funds diversion and Funds delay, we have</I></DIV>

<I>re-lengthily ensured that several foreign beneficiaries have been Paid</I></DIV>
<DIV>
<I>accordingly in order to retain and rekindle our country's reputation</I></DIV>
