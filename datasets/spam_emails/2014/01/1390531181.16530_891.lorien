e Syrians determine their own fate, so arming the opposition is 
more palatable than direct U.S. intervention.The administration announced 
last week that it believes Assad has used chemical weapons but said 
the intelligence wasn't clear enough to be certain that the regime has 
crossed President Barack Obama's announced "red line" of definite chemical 
weapons use that he said would have "enormous consequences" for Assad's 
government.Some senior leaders, including Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are skeptical about the wisdom of 
providing arms to such a broad and complex mix of opposition groups. 
But officials say there is a growing realization that, under increasing 
pressure from Congress and other allied nations, the U.S. might soon have 
to do more for the Free Syrian Army.The two-year civil war has 
left an estimated 70,000 people dead and hundreds of thousands of refugees.High-level 
meetings on the latest developments in the issue have been going on 
all week, including one between Dempsey and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, 
who just returned from the Mideast.According to a U.S. official and a 
U.N. diplomat, intelligence agencies are looking into allegations that chemical 
weapons were used in Syria after the two March 19 attacks that 
U.S., British, French and Qatari officials have referred to. They provided 
no details on the new alleged attacks.This emerging shift within the administration 
comes even as Assad a												
										Katy Perry 
Topless in Rolling StoneThe outrageous songstress likes getting sexy, doesn't 
like casual sex.Pop starKaty Perryhas been branded a devil child  by 
her own dad.Firebrand preacher Keith Perry also claims watching his daughters 
gigs is so hellish he ends up weeping because the fans are 
worshipping the singer instead of God, The Sun reports.And, in a string 
of sermons, he urges congregations to pray for Katy, whose hits include 
"I Kissed A Girl And I Liked It."Keith and wife Mary are 
currently touring American churches as star speakers.The pair show a video 
making Katy out to be a devil child who needs healing.Speaking in 
Santa Fe Springs, California, Keith ranted: They ask how can I preach 
if I produce a girl who sang about kissing another girl?I was 
at a concert of Katys where there were 20,000," he said. "Im 
watching this generation and they were going at it. It almost looked 
like church."I stood there and wept and kept on weeping and weeping," 
he added. "Theyre loving and worshipping the wrong thing.Go to The Sun 
for more.											
											Can 
you believe they dated?FRANKFURT, Germany  The European Central Bank and its president, Mario Draghi, 
have played a key role in fighting the government debt crisis afflicting 
the 17 European Union member countries that use the euro.The ECB is 
the issuer of the euro currency and serves as the top monetary 
authority for the eurozone and its 333 million people.Some of its key 
steps have been:LOWER INTEREST RATES: The ECB has cut its key interest 
rate four times since Draghi become president. This month the ECB lowered 
the so-called main refinancing rate further by a quarter-point to a record 
low of 0.5 percent.The refinancing rate is what the bank charges on 
the credit it offers to eurozone banks and thereby influences interest rates 
on the loans banks provide to each other, businesses and consumers. Theoretically, 
a lower rate means cheaper borrowing costs and more incentive to borrow 
money and expand a business. In practice, a slack economy has meant 
weak demand for loans.UNLIMITED BOND BUYS:  In 2012, high borrowing costs 
were threatening to push indebted countries such as Italy and Spain into 
a financial collapse that could have broken up the euro.Draghi took a 
major step toward calming the eurozone crisis by announcing last year that 
"within our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes 
to preserve the euro."The ECB followed through on Sept. 6 by offering 
to purchase unlimited amounts of bonds issued by heavily indebted countries,
