ny chapters in that wonderful story=2E The sea has much to say=3B far more =
than could possibly be comprehended in one volume, however large=2EIt tells=
 us of the doings of man on its broad bosom, from the day in which he first=
 ventured to paddle along shore in the hollow trunk of a tree, to the day w=
hen he launched his great iron ship of 20,000 tons, and rushed out to sea, =
against wind and tide, under an impulse equal to the united strength of 11,=
500 horses=2E No small portion of the ocean's tale this, comprising many ch=
apters of deeds of daring, blood, villainy, heroism, and enterprise=2E But =
with this portion of its story we have nothing to do just now=2E It tells u=
s, also, of God's myriad and multiform creatures, that dwell in its depths,=
 from the vast whale, whose speed is so great, that it might, if it chose, =
circle round the world in a few days, to the languid zoophyte, which clings=
 to the rock, and bears more resemblance to a plant than to a living animal=

There is a voice in the waters of the great sea=2E It calls to man continua=
lly=2E Sometimes it thunders in the tempest, when the waves leap high and s=
trong and the wild winds shriek and roar, as if to force our attention=2E S=
ometimes it whispers in the calm, and comes rippling on the shingly beach i=
n a still, small voice, as if to solicit our regard=2E But whether that voi=
ce of ocean comes in crashing billows or in gentle murmurs, it has but one =
tale to tell,--it speaks of the love, and power, and majesty of Him who rid=
