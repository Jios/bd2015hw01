My name is Steve Morgan and I work with a finance house here in the Netherl=
ands. During my company=2019s last meeting and examination of the bank acco=
unts within our company, my department found a dormant account with an enor=
mous sum of US$ 55,500,000.00 (fifty five million five hundred thousand US =
dollar) which was deposited by a late Mr. Williams from England before his =
death. From our investigation he had no next of kin to claim these funds. A=
ccording to the Netherlands banking regulation only a foreigner can stand a=
s next of kin, considering the fact that the depositor was a non-Dutch. I n=
eed your permission to stand as a relative of our deceased customer, so tha=
t the funds can be released and transferred to your bank account immediatel=
y. At the end of the transaction 40% will be for you and 60% will be for me=
 and my colleagues. I still work at the financial house and that's the reas=
on I need a second party to work with. I have in my possession all the nece=
ssary documents to have this transaction carried out successfully. Further =
information will be provided upon the receipt of your prompt response and I=
 want you to know that the transaction is risk free but all I need is your =
trust and honesty. Kindly reply me with your private email (for confidentia=
l reasons), telephone and fax number so I can give you more details and exp=
lain the procedures of the proposal to you. Please Kindly respond back to m=
e on this mail Stevemorgan39@aol.com Regards. Steve Morgan
