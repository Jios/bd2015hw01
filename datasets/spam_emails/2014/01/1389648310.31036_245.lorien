GREETINGS,

I know that this letter may be a very big surprise to you; I am giving you
my trust and wish you will give me back the trust i have given you. I
believe that you will be Honest to fulfill my final wish before I will
die.

I am MRS. VERONICA WILSON from CI, I am 59 years old, I am suffering from
a long time Cancer of the breast. From all indication my condition is
really deteriorating, and my Doctors have courageously advised me that I
may not live beyond next month; this is because the cancer stage has
reached a critical stage. I was brought up in a Motherless baby’s home,
and was married to my late husband for twenty years without a child. My
husband and I are true Christians, but quite unfortunately, he died in a
fatal motor accident.

Since his death I decided not to re-marry, I sold all my inherited
belongings and deposited all the sum of $4.2 Million Dollars with a
Financial Institute. Presently, this Money is still in their custody, and
the management just wrote me as the LEGITIMATE DEPOSITOR to inform me of
the maturity date of my deposit or rather issue a letter of Authorization
to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not come over as a
Result of my illness, or they get it confiscated.

It is my last wish to see that this money is been invested into a very
good LUCRATIVE VENTURE of your choice that will be giving out proceeds to
be distributed each year Among the charity organization, the poor and the
motherless baby’s, orphanage Homes and widows around. I must let you know
that this was a very hard decision, but I had to take a bold step towards
this issue because I have no further option.

I hope you will help me see that my last wishes come true.

Please kindly write me back via my email below for more details
information via this email address {mrsveronicaw@gmail.com}

Yours in Christ,

MRS. VERONICA WILSON
