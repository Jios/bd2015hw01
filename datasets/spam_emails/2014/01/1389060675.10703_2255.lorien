Dear Friend,=20

My name is Mr. William Parker; I am a senior banker in a bank here in the U=
nited Kingdom .=20

 =20

I am contacting you for a business transfer of a huge sum of money from a d=
eceased account. Though know that a transaction of this magnitude will make=
 any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that every documen=

 an attorney here in London , and all will be well at the end of the day.=20

I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction. The deceas=

money as his heir, because they all died in the same accident himself and h=

 account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the decease=
d as indicated in our banking guidelines. Upon this discovery, I now seek y=
our permission to stand as a next of kin to the deceased, as all documentat=
ions will be carefully worked to make you the beneficiary to the funds #6,1=
00 000 00 GBP (Six million, one hundred thousand Great British pounds sterl=

 twenty years the money will be called back to the bank bond treasury as un=
claimed bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank. So it=
 is on this note I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the n=
ext of kin/beneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors t=
o share this money amongst them at the end of th

ting you with 50% of the above amount on final conclusion of this project f=
or your assistance, the balance 50% shall be for me, because I intend to re=
tire after the conclusion of this transaction.=20

ately. Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed in you, I a=
