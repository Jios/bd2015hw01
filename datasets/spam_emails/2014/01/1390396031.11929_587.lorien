Hello Bruceg
                                               
If you contrast all the features of our watch and the real one, you will notice no dissimilarity apart from the price.
We offer goods that have a name, purpose and the best possible price.
                                              
----------------------------------------------------
FANTASTIC WATCH. 100% AS DESCRIBED. MY JEWELER COULD NOT TELL IT WAS NOT A REAL ROLEX. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER.
Thank
                     Rocky Whitney
