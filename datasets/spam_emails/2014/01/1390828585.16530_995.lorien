Along with the battery, the atomizer is the central component of every
personal vaporizer. Although many kinds of atomizers are in use, they
generally consist of a small heating element responsible for vaporizing
liquid, as well as a wicking material that draws liquid in. A small
length of resistance wire is wrapped around the wicking material and
then connected to the positive and negative poles of the device. When
activated the resistance wire (or coil) quickly heats up thus turning
the liquid into a vapor, which is then inhaled by the user. The
electrical resistance of the coil and the voltage output of a device
play important roles in the perceived quality of the vapor that is
produced by an atomizer. Atomizer resistances usually vary from 1.5?
(ohms) to 3.0? from one atomizer to the next but can go as low as 0.1?
in the most extreme cases of DIY coil building which produce large
amounts of vapor but could present a fire hazard and other dangerous
battery failures if the user is not knowledgeable enough about basic
electrical principles and how they relate to battery safety.
Wicking materials vary greatly from one atomizer to another but silica
fibers are the most commonly used in manufactured atomizers.
"Rebuildable" or "do it yourself" atomizers can use silica, cotton,
porous ceramic, hemp, bamboo yarn, oxidized stainless steel mesh and
even wire rope cables as wicking materials. A wide array of
atomizers and e-liquid container combinations are available:
Cartomizers Most of the devices that imitate the cigarette form factor
use a "cartomizer" (a portmanteau of cartridge and atomizer) as an
e-liquid delivery system. The piece consists of a heating element
surrounded by a liquid-soaked poly-foam that acts as an e-liquid
holder. It is usually disposed of once the e-liquid acquires a burnt
taste, which is usually due to an activation when the coil is dry or
when the cartomizer gets consistently flooded (gurgling) because of
sedimentation of the wick. Most cartomizers are refillable even if not
advertised as such. Cartomizers can be used on their own or in
conjunction with a tank that allows more e-liquid capacity. In this
case the portmanteau word of "cartotank" has been coined. When used in
a tank, the cartomizer is inserted in a plastic, glass or metal tube
and holes or slots have to be punched on the sides of the cartomizer to
allow liquid to reach the coil.[citation needed] Clearomizers eGo style
e-cigarette with a top-coil clearomizer. Silica fibers are hanging down
freely inside of the tank, drawing e-liquid by capillary action to the
coil that is locate directly under the mouth piece. Clearomizers, not
unlike cartotanks, use a clear tank in which an atomizer is inserted.
Unlike cartotanks, however, no poly-foam material can be found in them.
There are a lot of different wicking systems employed inside of
clearomizers to ensure good moistening of the wick without flooding the
coil. Some rely on gravity to bring the e-liquid to the wick and coil
assembly (bottom coil clearomizers for example) whereas others rely on
capillary action alone (top coil clearomizers).[citation needed]
Rebuildable Atomizers A rebuildable atomizer is an atomizer that allows
the user to assemble or "build" the wick and coil themselves.
