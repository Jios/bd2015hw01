Dear Sir

With all sincerity and humility it is with deep pains i write you this mess=
age of wishful assistance to my predicament.

I am Raymond Taylor the only son of last wife to the former president of Li=
beria who was asked by unanimous decision by the international community to=
 step down from the corridors of power .

I write you this mail under duress and as a result of my recent decision to=
 better the lives of me. I have made a decision which i know might not be g=
ood in the sight of man but the present situation has led me to this decisi=
on to better the lives of me.Currently now  have decided to make do with th=
e sum of six hundred million us dollars(600.000.000)United States Dollars b=
elonging to my father in which i am a benefiaciary,when he went into exile =
in Nigeria. In 2006.

On 29 March, My father tried to cross the border into Cameroon through the =
border town of Gamboru in northeastern Nigeria . His Range Rover with Niger=
ian diplomatic plates was stopped by border guards, and Taylor 's identity =
was eventually established.State Department staff later reported that signi=
ficant amounts of cash were found in the vehicle.

Upon his arrival at Roberts International Airport in Harbel , Liberia , Tay=
lor was arrested and handcuffed by LNP officers, who then immediately trans=
ferred custody of Taylor to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL). =
Irish UNMIL soldiers then escorted Taylor aboard a UN helicopter to Freetow=
n, Sierra Leone ,where he was delivered to the SCSL.

I have decided to relocate with your assistance to your private account the=
 said sum.My decision was reached when i could not conceive the thought tha=
t after the United States Government has promised to let my father go free =
based on the condition that he should step down Mr.Collin Powell stated in =
a press briefing that he would be indicted by the court in Netherlands to f=
ace charges on war crimes,this is what led to my decision as God Knows that=
 i was never in support of his involvement in the indecent maltreating of i=
nnocent people in Politics.

This decision is hard for me to make but i just have to make it for the sak=
e of my me future.Currently the said sum was lodged in a safety deposit box=
 in a financial company Institution which i will disclose to you as a matte=
r of commitment to me and this plea for assistance. I currently have the de=
posit certificate and can draw up a change of beneficiary mandate to effect=
 you as the beneficiary to the funds.

I am a trained economist by profession and it is in this line that i will w=
ant you to take note that your services for assisting me will be compensate=
d to the best of my ability.

I have this to look forward to so i would like you to keep this project clo=
se to your heart just as myself pending when we reach the conclusive end of=
 this project. I will want you as a matter of confidentiality to respond th=
rough this mail and also include your telephone number as well so that i ca=
n give you a call if the need arises as we are currently on political asylu=
m now in west africa. Once get your confirmation that you can be of assista=
nce i will bring you into a clearer picture of the situation at hand.

I look forward to your response with great hope of assistance.
I remain Yours Truly,
Raymond Taylor
