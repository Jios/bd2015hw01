Hi to you Aron
As I look at the stars at night and dream of what is waiting for us...
When people understand the true meaning of love and feel worthy to accept such a gift, love will find a path to one's heart without any effort.
People are not perfect but I would like to be perfect for my sweetheart addr_3
I'm longing for that first look into his sparkling  eyes, that first kiss, that first we hold hands and walk in a park.
I am looking for active, emotional, cheerful, sociable and passionate  man.
A rivederci
Alexandri
