Dear friend,
=20

I know that this message will come to you as a surprise. I am Dr.Abu Salam =
from Burkina Faso the Accounting and Auditing Manager bank of Africa (B.O.A=
), Ouagadougou
=20

I hoped that you will not expose or betray this trust and confident that I =
am about to repose on you for the mutual benefit of our families. I need yo=
ur urgent assistance in transferring the sum of (usd$10.5m) million to your=
 account within 10 to 14 banking days. This money has been dormant for year=
s in our bank without claim. I want the bank to release the money to you as=
 the nearest person to our deceased customer (the owner of the account) die=
d along with his supposed next of kin in an air crash since July, 2007.
=20


I don't want the money to go into our bank treasurer account as an abandone=
d fund. So this is the reason why I contacted you so that the bank can rele=
ase the money to you as the next of kin to the deceased customer. Please I =
would like you to keep this proposal as a top secret and delete it if you a=
re not upon receipt of your reply, I will give you full details on how the =
business will be executed and also note that you will have 35% of the above=
 mentioned sum if you agree to handle this business with me? And 10% will b=
e set aside for any expenses that warrant on the process before the fund ge=
t into your bank account such as telephone calls bills (etc).
=20


Finally send your photo or your international passports for more identifica=
tion.
=20

Best Regards,
Dr.Abu Salam
