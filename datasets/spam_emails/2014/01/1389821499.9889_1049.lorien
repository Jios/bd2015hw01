Hello Lists
                               
There’s no battery in these replicas just like the real ones since they get recharged as you move.
Do you know what is the only dissimilarity between our watches and the real brand watches? You are right, it is the cost and that is it.

My order arrived yesterday via registered mail in good order THE WATCH IS BEAUTIFUL AND EVEN BETTER THAN I EXPECTED.
Thanks
                     Iris Wolff
