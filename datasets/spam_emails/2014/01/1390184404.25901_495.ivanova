Hello Dearest,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I am contacting you to assist me,please contact me directly to my email address:&nbsp; jsmith.appeal@gmail.com&nbsp; </DIV>

<DIV>
I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains as you read this.I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is Mr Jim Smith, a merchant here in London, presently taking medical treatment. now, I have been diagnosed with Prostate and Esophageala cancer that was discovered very late due to my uncaring attitude for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business and money. </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for.But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is almost up, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money which I have there to which I have there to some charity organizations in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves, Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be content with what I have left for them.</DIV>
<DIV>
 The last of my money is the huge cash deposit ($15 Million USD) that I have in a Bank, I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations.</DIV>
