aws unpopularity increases, endangered Democrats will distance themselves 
from the law and join the chorus of critics. If that happens, 
the chances of delay, major alteration or eventual repeal of the law 
increase dramatically.And if Obama thinks its hard to appear potent now, 
just wait until Democrats start dogging his law to try to get 
re-elected.And Now, A Word From CharlesChain of custody? What is this, "CSI 
Damascus? In the middle of a war you expect a chain of 
custody in deciding if a weapon was used?-- Charles Krauthammer on Special 
Report with Bret Baier.Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox 
News, and his POWER PLAY column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com. Catch 
Chris Live online daily at 11:30amET at http:live.foxnews.com.This April 2013 image shows Yosemite Valley at Yosemite National Park in 
California.APTwo months after the sequester hit, the Department of Interior 
continues to warn of coast-to-coast cuts for the country's national parks 
-- and even the partial shutdown of a critical flood warning system.But 
Sen. Tom Coburn says there's "no shortage of potential savings," pointing 
out that the department is nevertheless spending millions on newly created 
monuments and landmarks.The Oklahoma Republican, who has been hounding federal 
agencies for weeks about questionable spending under the cloud of sequester, 
aired his grievances with the Interior Department in a letter to Secretary 
Sally Jewell Tuesday."It makes little sense to expand the number of sites 
at the same time the budget of every other park is being 
cut and visitors are being turned away from visiting the White House," 
Coburn wrote.Coburn pointedly questioned department efforts to name new 
sites and expand others -- decisions that will contribute to the department's 
annual costs. Coburn said the National Park Service has designated 13 new 
historic landmarks and three new monuments since the sequester hit March 
1. One of those landmarks, he noted, is a whiskey distillery -- 
the George T. Stagg Distillery in Kentucky. Other newly created landmarks 
include the Connecticut home of abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe, the 
historic bridge crossed by civil rights marchers in Selma, Ala., and an 
artion.The Democratic primary pits U.S. Rep. Edward Markey, who has 
staked out more liberal positions, against fellow Rep. Stephen Lynch, a 
former ironworker who has tried to appeal to the party's working- and 
middle-class base.Lynch, 58, has had to defend his decision to vote against 
President Obama's 2010 health care law, while Markey, who won his first 
elected office while in law school, has fended off efforts to portray 
him as a Washington insider.Markey, 66, is the better-funded of the two 
Democratic candidates, having raised $4.8 million through the end of the 
last reporting period, compared with $1.5 million for Lynch.Markey has also 
benefited from outside spending. Of the more than $2.2 million spent by 
outside groups, nearly 84 percent went to Markey, an Associated Press review 
of Federal Election Commission reports found.In the town of Wayland in his 
congressional district, voters trickled in to polling places.Holly Zaitchik, 
a 66-year-old retired Boston University professor, said she voted for Markey 
because he's "he's done a terrific job of being there when anything 
important happens" in Washington.Zaitchik also thought the Marathon bombings 
might discourage turnout among voters still coping with the aftermath."There 
are a lot of people who are still down and not wanting 
to participate in things," she said. "It's disheartening."The GOP primary 
race is pitting three candidates: former U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts 
Michael Sulli
