Hello Lists
        
But what should you do if you can not afford the unique luxurious watches for all these wear?
If a watch comes with leather bands, it is 100% genuine pelt. Get one of them and lose all your misgivings.
 
**************************************
Today I received my two watches. Both watches were spectacular, you guys did a wonderful job and I will definitely recommend you to all my friends!
Thanks
                     Ian Dunbar
