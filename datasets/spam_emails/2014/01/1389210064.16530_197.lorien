disclosing to him things ineffable and inconceivable,--are not his writings=
 to be most truly called inspired? Can we doubt that, in what he has told u=
s of things not seen, or not seen as yet,--of Him who pre-existed in the fo=
rm of God before he was manifested in the form of man,--of that great day, =
when we shall arise incorruptible, and meet our Lord in the air, and be joi=
ned to him for ever,--can any reasonable mind doubt, that in speaking of th=
ese things he spoke what he had heard from God; that to refuse to believe h=
is testimony is really to disbelieve God? Yet this great Apostle expected t=

his world is passing away." And again, when speaking of the resurrection, h=
e says emphatically, "the dead shall rise incorruptible, and _we_ shall be =
changed;" where the pronoun being expressed in the original, [Greek: chai h=

 dead, but those who were to be alive at Christ's coming. So again, still l=

 at hand;" and later still, even in his first epistle to Timothy, he charge=
