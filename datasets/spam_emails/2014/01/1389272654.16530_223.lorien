obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a piece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 it, drawing my shoe raspingly

along the stone. Then I wandered down f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 to the beach and sprawled out on the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 sand. Most of thebig shore places were closed now and there

were hardly any lights except the XJG shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. ADTTUTQG f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 And as the moon SVVXSBEP rose higher the inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I


became aware of the old island here TBYU that flowered once for Dutch sailors’ eyes — BEGUBHC f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 a fresh, green rest of the new world. Its vanished trees, the trees f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 that had made way


for Gatsby’s house, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all human f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his breath in the


presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the last time in history with something


commensurate to his capacity for wonder. And as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 I thought of Gatsby’s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy’s


dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him, BINHIQB




somewhere back in that vast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of DNXT the republic rolled on under the night. Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future

that year by year recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that’s no matter — to-morrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms UQRSQLTUD f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 farther. . . . And f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 one fine morning ——



So we beat on, boats against the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 current, borne back ceaselessly into the past. There was a large, brilliant evening star in the early


twilight, and underfoot the earth was half frozen. It was Christmas Eve. Also the War was over, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 and there was a sense of relief that PXD was almost a new menace. MYJS A man felt the

violence of the nightmare f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 released f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 now into the general air. Also there had been another wrangle among f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 men on the pit- bank that evening.

Aaron Sisson ULDYMNOVV HYBU was the last man on the little WXPQRLHF black railway-line climbing the hill home from work. He was late because he had attended a meeting

of the men on the bank. He FFJVDOK was secretary to the Miners Union for his f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 colliery, and had heard a FXEALJ good deal of silly wrangling that left him nettled.


He strode over a stile, BAWP crossed two fields, strode XUWX another stile, and was in the long road of colliers’ dwellings. Just across was his f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 own

house: he had built it himself. He went through the little gate, up past the side of the house to YRWYK the back. NSVVYDDKY f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 There he hung a moment, glancing down the GBM dark, LBSNP wintry garden.

“My father — my father’s CQPBIQXHQ come!” cried a child’s WANXM excited voice, and ERK two little girls in white pinafores ran out in front of f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 his f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 legs.


“Father, shall you CSNF set the Christmas FPNG Tree?” they cried. “We’ve got one!” “Afore I have my dinner?” he CAHUPW answered f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 amiably. .
