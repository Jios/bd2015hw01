JOHANNESBURG  Mozambique's rhinoceros population was wiped out more than 
a century ago by big game hunters. Reconstituted several years ago, it 
has again been driven to extinction, or to the brink of extinction, 
by poachers seeking their horns for sale in Asia.A leading rhino expert 
told The Associated Press that the last rhino in the southern African 
nation has been killed. The warden in charge of the Great Limpopo 
Transfrontier Park   the only place where the horned behemoths lived 
in Mozambique    also says poachers have wiped out the 
last of the rhinos. Mozambique's conservation director believes a few may 
remain.Elephants also could become extinct in Mozambique soon, the warden 
of the Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park, Antonio Abacar, told AP. He said 
game rangers have been aiding poachers, and 30 of the park's 100 
rangers will appear in court soon."We caught some of them red-handed while 
directing poachers to a rhino area," Abacar said.A game ranger arrested 
for helping poachers in Mozambique's northern Niassa Game Reserve said on 
Mozambican Television TVM last week that he was paid 2,500 meticais (about 
$80) to direct poachers to areas with elephants and rhinos. Game rangers 
are paid between 2,000 and 3,000 meticais ($64 to $96) a month.While 
guilty rangers will lose their jobs, the courts serve as little deterrent 
to the poachers: killing wildlife and trading in illegal rhino horn and 
elephant tusks are only misdemeanors in Mozamat could eventually affect 
our national security in the short term," the source said. "And we're 
not talking midterm or long-term, this is the short-term."The source said 
"it's a daily frustration."Another threat is a larger terrorist haven that 
continues to build in parts of Libya and North Africa. Those working 
the region in the interest of U.S. security say the ball is 
being dropped by top leaders at the White House, Pentagon and State 
Department."Benghazi, the second-highest population of foreign fighters, 
and the war in Iraq came from Benghazi, second to Saudi Arabia, 
so we are talking about a historic location and region that has 
fed foreign fighters to kill Americans, and kill other coalition forces," 
one source said."The analysts, the intelligence experts all say the same 
thing, that if we just ignore the situation as it presents itself, 
eventually it will be another invasion will have to take place for 
us to eventually turn the tide."He says the region also remains a 
weapons hub after the overthrow of former leader Muammar Qaddafi in 2011, 
which saw massive stockpiles of weapons in Libya move freely across the 
Mediterranean and in many cases into Syria. While the U.S. has claimed 
a more active role to find and remove an estimated 20,000 shoulder-launched 
missiles called MANPADS, some Americans working the area say they aren't 
allowed to take or even destroy the missiles because they have not 
been given the authority from theiJoanne Chesimard, who killed a New Jersey cop 40 years ago today, 
then escaped prison and fled to Cuba, has been labeled a terrorist 
and had a $2 million bounty put on her by the FBI, 
authorities said Thursday.Chesimard was serving a life term for killing 
a New Jersey state trooper in 1973 when she escaped prison. After 
hiding out in a New Jersey safe house for several years, Chesimard 
managed to flee in 1979 to Cuba, where she has been living 
for decades under the name Assata Shakur."Joanne Chesimard is a domestic 
terrorist," Aaron T. Ford, special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark 
division, said at a press conference Thursday. "She absolutely is a threat 
to America."Chesimard, a member of the radical Black Liberation Army, shot 
and killed New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster execution-style on May 
2, 1973, after she and two others were pulled over for a 
routine traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike, about an hour south 
of New York City.Chesimard, 26 at the time, was already known by 
the FBI for her involvement in the Black Panther movement. She had 
changed her name to Shakur and was now a leader of the 
Black Liberation Army  one of the most violent militant black organizations 
of the 1970s. She was wanted in connection with a string of 
felonies, including bank robberies in New York.After being pulled over by 
the troopers, Chesimard, who was in the passenger seat, pulled out her 
semi-automatic pistol and fired the first shot.
