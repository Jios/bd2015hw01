Dear Friend</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
I know 1that you miglht be surprise on this mail, but I am telling you the truth. I know that it is against my official duty to release confidential issue like this to an outsider. There is nothing I can do to help you beside this, I am taking this bold step because of my belief as a Christian.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
What I want to tell you is about your contract/inheritance and lottery payments with the Federal Government of Nigeria, there are a lot forces working against you right from the&nbsp; last CBN Governor Chief Sanusi and the immediate past Governor Prof Charles Soludo, they have been frustrating you by demanding upfront payment from you constantly, If I tell you that they are using all these money you sent to them to work against you, you might not believe it. But it is reality.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
There is a way I can assist you get your fund without you paying any charges to get your fund, it is risk but one have to take it, I have assisted one woman from Mexico with it, it worked out though her fund was US$10.5m.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
What you have to do is to open another bank account any where, if you can open it in another place, it will be nice, but what you have to bear in mind is that you have to re- transfer the fund to another account immediately you confirmed it in your account, I know why I want it this way.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
If you want me to go ahead, let me know as soon as you get this mail, if I make the transfer on this week, it might be next month that they will find out and by then, you have re-transferred the fund into another account.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Get back to me as soon as you get this fax, via email:ruthezmail1@gmail.com , so that I will be in better position to know what to do.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Sincerely yours,</DIV>
