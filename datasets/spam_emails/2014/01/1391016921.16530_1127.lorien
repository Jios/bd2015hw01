The White House budget office is recalculating how to apply automatic spending 
cuts for a handful of agencies, freeing up almost $4 billion for 
the Pentagon and another $1 billion or so for Homeland Security Department 
and NASA.Capitol Hill aides familiar with the White House changes say the 
administration has identified almost $5 billion in cuts that can be restored 
under its reading of the arcane budget rules governing the across-the-board 
cuts, known as sequestration. The calculations would restore $5 billion 
of the scheduled $85 billion in automatic sequestration cuts.An administration 
official confirmed the calculations Friday but declined to comment further 
because the process is ongoing. The official and congressional aides spoke 
on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the 
changes publicly.The move comes amid increasing public pressure to find 
ways to lessen the impact of sequestration. Federal agencies are warning 
that the mandatory cuts could mean cutbacks in services. Last week, Congress 
passed and President Obama signed legislation giving the Federal Aviation 
Administration the ability to avoid furloughs that were causing flight delays 
by tapping money in other accounts.The cuts officially began in March after 
Congress and Obama could not reach an agreement on a broader budget 
deal. The automatic cuts had been imposed under a hard-fought 2011 debt 
and budget pact.The cuts have so far failed to liveThe Homeland Security Department ordered border agents "effective immediately" 
to verify that every international student who arrives in the U.S. has 
a valid student visa, according to an internal memorandum obtained Friday 
by The Associated Press. The new procedure is the government's first security 
change directly related to the Boston bombings.The order from a senior official 
at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, David J. Murphy, was circulated Thursday 
and came one day after the Obama administration acknowledged that a student 
from Kazakhstan accused of hiding evidence for one of the Boston bombing 
suspects was allowed to return to the U.S. in January without a 
valid student visa.The student visa for Azamat Tazhayakov had been terminated 
when he arrived in New York on Jan. 20. But the border 
agent in the airport did not have access to the information in 
the Homeland Security Department's Student and Exchange Visitor Information 
System, called SEVIS.Tazhayakov was a friend and classmate of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's 
at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Tazhayakov left the U.S. in 
December and returned Jan. 20. But in early January, his student-visa status 
was terminated because he was academically dismissed from the university.Tazhayakov 
and a second Kazakh student were arrested this week on federal charges 
of obstruction of justice. They were accused of helping to get rid 
of a backpack containing fireworks linked to Tsarnaev. A thiins, 
based on police records.West Fertilizer did not have a fence or security 
guards, and just one security camera was installed, Cawthon said. Besides 
the costs of adding security, the plant was often visited after hours 
by farmers needing fertilizer."If the owner was to spend that money to 
make this a fortress, it would decrease his business because the farmers 
can't come and go," Cawthon said.Daniel Keeney, a spokesman for Adair Grain, 
which owned and operated the plant, declined to answer questions about plant 
security to avoid "misunderstandings or confusions."Last month's explosion 
occurred during the spring planting season, when the plant was especially 
busy, officials in the investigation have said. Two months before the explosion, 
plant officials reported they could store as much as 270 tons of 
ammonium nitrate.Teams from the state fire marshal's office and the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are hoping to determine 
how much ammonium nitrate was on site when the blast occurred by 
studying the 90-foot-crater left in the explosion and combing through records.
