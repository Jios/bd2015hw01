Electronic cigarettes on average have much, much higher success rates in ge=
tting people to stop smoking cigarettes (not stop using nicotine) than nico=
tine patches, gum, lozenges or otherwise. Whether or not you can break your=
 nicotine addiction has to do with both the electronic cigarettes you choos=
e and your willpower to stop using nicotine overall.If you decide to go wit=
h electronic cigarettes, start with something that will be similar to your =
nicotine habit. If you only smoke a half pack a day go with a 12-16mg, "Med=
ium" or "Low" dose and then step down, over time just like you would with n=
icotine gum or patches.=
