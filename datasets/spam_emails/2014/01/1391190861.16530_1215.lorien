=3D"font-size: xx-small;"> NO!Well, it really depends on how Sh=
e will recieve them. Some girls just melt at being given flowers for any re=
ason. Others (at times like this) will see it as insulting, or crawling (in=
 a bad way). Others just don't like getting flowers at all for any reason!T=
hen you have to think of Her. .... You may mean well by doing this, &amp; l=
et's suppose your girlfriend is the type who is just going to melt at being=
 given them. ... You now have to Think of exactly how this will affect Her =
by recieving them At HER Work!! Everyone else around her might think it's g=
reat too, BUT,,, it can also be very embarrasing for Her! Remember,,, &quot=
;LOVE&quot; is a Private matter between people! If you need to do this thin=
g so openly in front of others,,, I suggest that the giving of flowers is f=
or YOUR Benefit, Not hers, &amp; that sending them to her work is just your=
 way of 'performing' in front of an audience. ...... This is not love my fr=
iend. It is you showing a selfish need for attention. .... My Advice. .... =
Do the flower thing, but do it in a less humiliating environment than 'HER =
Work'. You Could take her out to dinner, (nothing fancy), &amp; have the fl=
owers delivered to her at the table. That IS Romantic, even though there ar=
e other people around. ................ I do hope that I have Helped you ou=
t, &amp; I did not mean to be insulting towards you, merely to point things=
 out. ... &quot;Good Luck!&quot;.................EDIT:: P.S. ... IF You hav=
e to send her 'something',,, a Better idea is to send her a Box of Chocolat=
es! (assuming that she does like chocolates of course!) Sending Chocolates =
to a girl is better than sending Flowers to her, because of the added messa=
ge. You see, Most Girls / Women seem to pay a lot of attention on their own=
 appearance,looks,weight,&amp; size. (do you see what I'm leading up to?) M=
any women who like eating chocolates will often refrain from doing so just =
because they think it will spoil their looks, size etc. But, If you as her =
boyfriend send her chocolates, you are telling her that you love her for he=
rself, &amp; not for how she looks! Well, that's just 1 of many hidden mess=
ages in sending chocolates! But,,, For God's Sake, &amp; YOURS,, Do NOT Sen=
d 'Sugar Free' or 'Diet Chocolates'!! that will have the OPPOSITE Effect! (=
mind you, it's a good way to start WW3 </span></span></center><img src=3D=
