Dear Friend, 

I am Mrs Caramel Perkins. I am a US citizen and i am 35 years Old. I reside here in Brooklyn, New York. USA and I am thinking of relocating since I am now rich.

I am one of those that took part in the United Nation compensation program in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me. I had paid over $20,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment but all was to no  avail.

So I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my compensation documents and I was directed to meet Mr Jaff Camron, who is the member of COMPENSATION PROGRAM COMMITTEE and I contacted him and he explained everything to me better.

He said who ever is contacting us through emails are fake. He also took me to the paying bank (ZENITH BANK) for the claim of my compensation payment. 

Right now, I am the happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation fund of $5,000,000.00. Mr Jaff Camron showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email as one of the beneficiaries who have not yet received the payment under CASE FILE 54AC003 and that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with any other person. They're only making money off you because they're not with your fund.

Therefore, I would advise you to contact Mr Jaff Camron for assistance and inform him that your CASE FILE is 54AC003. Contact him directly via the information below.

UNITED NATIONS COMPENSATION AWARD PROGRAM
Name : Mr. Jaff Camron 
Email: jaffcamron101@att.net
Phone: +234-802-132-9323. 

You really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them. I have news for you, it is not. They're only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr Jaff Camron was the bank transfer charges and taxes in the country, which is only normal and legitimate as it is in all banks in the world. So please take note Mr Jaff Camron shall ensure that you deal directly with the bank(ZENITH BANK).

Once again stop contacting those people. I advise that you should contact Mr Jaff Camron so that he can help you in the collection of your transfer payment instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction. 

Thank you and be blessed.

Mrs. Caramel Perkins.
