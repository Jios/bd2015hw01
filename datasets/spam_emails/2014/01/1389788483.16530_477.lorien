With all the various warranty plans out there, it can be tricky to find
the right warranty to cover you automobile. Unfortunately, not all
extended car warranties provide the same coverage or options and you
need to choose carefully. The following are the main criteria we used
to evaluate the best extended car warranty services. Coverage What do
you need covered? Many warranties let you specialize in what you want
to cover -- for example, powertrain, transmission or electrical.
Perhaps you would like to get a bumper-to-bumper warranty that covers
almost all of the car's systems. Whatever you are looking for, be sure
to pay special attention to what your contract will and won't cover.
For example, many times a warranty will cover a certain type of damage
like mechanical failure, but not incidental damage caused by
overheating. It is also important to consider how long the policy will
last, if it is available in every state or if the warranty will cover
roadside assistance or rental car reimbursement. Watch for mileage
limitations and if the warranty will cover a towing service if you end
up stranded somewhere. Claim Services Having great service is what
really sets an auto warranty company apart from the competition. Look
for a warranty provider that gives you online and phone quotes on your
vehicle. An affordable payment plan is also a great service that most
providers offer. This nice feature lets you spread out the cost instead
of demanding the whole sum all at once. Make sure that your warranty is
transferrable as well. This can be a big perk if you sell your car
since many buyers look for a warranty to give them confidence in their
purchase. The best warranties allow you to choose your own repair shop
and do not require you to pay upfront. This is handy, especially if you
have problems while you are away from home. It is comforting to know
that you'll still be covered no matter where you are. Help & Support
The best extended car warranties come with excellent service and
support. Most companies can be reached during normal business hours,
but what happens if you need help in the middle of the night? Look for
warranties that include 24/7 service, by telephone, live chat or email.
Also, be sure to find a company that provides adequate information
about their warranties and policies upfront on their website. This is
especially important, as being able to see the contract documentation
beforehand and getting answers to your questions before you sign for an
extended car warranty will help you make the choice that benefits you
the most. It can be nerve-wracking, not knowing when you will have to
pay for a major car repair, but finding the right extended car warranty
doesn't have to be a hassle, especially if you use these criteria to
find the policy that gives you the best coverage, claim services and
support.
