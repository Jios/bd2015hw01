criminal background of persons working with children came into force
from the beginning of 2003. The act being in force, a special extract
can be issued from the criminal records: extract on criminal
background. Extract on criminal background has become subject to a
charge in the beginning of 2012 The extract on criminal background,
which is required of people working with children and can be obtained
from the Legal Register Centre, has become subject to a charge. From
1-1-2012, the extract will be subject to a charge in accordance with
the Act on Criteria for Charges Payable to the State, which means that
the size of the charge corresponds to the actual costs incurred from
issuing the extract. The charge will be 13.40 euros. An invoice will be
sent separately. From the beginning of year 2012 an educational
institution may require an extract on criminal background from the
student if the studies include job learning or training that is carried
out with children. Extract obtained for studies is free of charge. The
extract from the criminal records ordered by a private person for any
other purpose, such as for a foreign work or residence permit, is
already nowadays subject to a charge. An extract on criminal background
is only granted to the person concerned. The person cannot authorize
e.g. his/her employer to order the extract. The extract is merely
intended to be presented to an employer or an approving authority for
inspection. The employer or the authority must not gather or store the
data of the extract on criminal background. The employer can only make
a note in his documents of the extract having been presented and in
this connection write down the identifying data of the extract, those
being the name of the person in question and the date of the extract.
Ministry of Employment and the Economy has issued more detailed
instructions on the employer's obligation to demand the extract on
criminal background for inspection, as well as on other related
matters. The instructions are available (in Finnish) on the web pages
of the Ministry of Employment and the Economy. Ordering the extract
When ordering the extract, you must state for which employer and job
you order it. If the applicant for a job, within the above-mentioned
six months' period of validity, has to present his/her register data
yet to another employer than for whom the extract was ordered, he/she
can use the previously ordered extract. The procedure of checking the
criminal background is not applied to employment relationships or civil
service relationships that last the maximum period of three months. The
extract on criminal background will be sent to that address which is
valid in the population register. Time of delivery is seven working
days. When a citizen of another EU-country is concerned, Legal Register
Centre will enquire the criminal background information also from the
member state and the time of delivery will be seven + ten working days.
An invoice will be sent separately.
