Greetings To You.
 
I am Dr.John C.C Chan{JP} a South Korean citizen and one of the Directors in Hang Seng Bank Limited here in Hong-Kong. I will need you to assist me in
executing a business project worth US$25.5 Million. These funds were deposited with our bank by a customer who unfortunately died in an earthquake/Tsunami disaster.
 
The deceased account has been declared dormant and these funds will be confiscated/declared serviceable and turned over to the Hong Kong government
if the deceased relations or business associates did not claim it, since all efforts to trace any living relative of the deceased proved abortive.  
of this deposit were kept under my care.
 
During this transaction, I shall send you all my legal and valid Identities, meanwhile do please endeavor to observe utmost discretion
in all matters concerning this issue, as I hope you are sincere, honest, matured person. successfully transferred into your account, 
we shall share it in a ratio of 45% for you, 50% for me and 5% for my associates in the bank to take care of contingencies.
