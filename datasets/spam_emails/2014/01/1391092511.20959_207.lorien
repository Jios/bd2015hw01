<FONT size=3 face="Courier">My name is Morgan Peterson and I work with the finance house here in the Netherlands. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">I found your address through my countries international Web directory. During our last meeting and examination of the bank accounts here in the Netherlands, my department found a dormant account with an enormous sum of US$ 6,500,000.00 (Six million five hundred thousand US dollar) which was deposited by late Mr. Williams from England.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">Before his death he transferred the sum of US$ 6,500,000.00 (Six million five hundred thousand US dollar) to a bank here in Netherlands. From our investigation he had no beneficiary or next of kin to claim these funds.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">Because of our financial house regulations only one foreigner can stand as next relatives or next of kin. The request of a foreigner as a next of kin is base on the fact that the depositor was a foreigner and somebody in the Netherlands cannot stand as the next of kin.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">I need your permission as the next relative or next of kin of our deceased customer, so that the funds can be released and transferred to your account, at the end of the transaction 40% will be for you and 60% will be for me and my colleague.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">We need a foreign account. I still work at the financial house and that's the actual reason that I need a second party or person, to stand and work with me and apply to the bank here in the Netherlands as the next of kin. I have in my possession all the necessary documents to have this transaction carried out successfully.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">Further information will be provided upon the receipt of your prompt response and I want you to know that there is no risk involved. I will need us to work together if you are interested and I assure you that I will provide all useful information and documentation as this business needs urgent attention as there is no much time to waste.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier"> </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 face="Courier">Kindly Write me directly with your Name, Address, telephone and fax number on this emailmorganpetersons@aol.com so I can explain the procedures.</FONT></DIV>
