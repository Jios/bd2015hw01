COMPENSATIONAL SETTLEMENT OF ESCROW ACCOUNTS.



It is a pleasure to write you that we have reconciled with our logistic
department of United Kingdom on the reimbursement of some fund spent by
you during the cause of your inadequate dealings with some imposters who
claim to be staff in banks and other regional payment centers. Our
reconciliation teams with the prospectus instrument of the United Nations
after freezing suspected imposters account. This support was fully
effective with the help of World Bank after a summit meeting in London, on
the financial analysis on financial stability issues fluctuating their
economy with the international global standard.



After gathering of this sum, our logistic department gave us a list of
customers to be paid who fell victims to these imposters due to
unawareness. And mode of payment was as well specified for proper conducts
and financial regulations to kick against criminality during process of
payment. We have arranged your payment through our swift card centers,
with the latest instruction from International Monetary Fund
Reconciliation Office.



A bank draft of  £200,000.00 GBP(TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND GREAT BRTISH
POUNDS),will be sent to you and you can cash it in any Banks in the world,
You are hereby selected as an honor for this payment approval, which you
are to acknowledge the receipt of this mail in returning the required
