“Set it now. Set it now.— We got it through Fred Alton. ” “Where is it?” The little girls were dragging a rough, dark object out MTNKWT



of a corner of the phiage into the light of ENAGDVDXO the kitchen door. “It’s a TWBBJ beauty!” exclaimed Millicent. “Yes, it is,” said Marjory. “I should think so,” he replied, striding over the dark


bough. NHK He went to the back kitchen to take off IFHI his coat. “Set it now, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 Father. Set it VQTIEPWOP now, ” clamoured SSDSC the girls. “You might as well. You’ve left your dinner so long, you



might as well do it now before you have it,” came a woman’s plangent voice, out of the brilliant light of the middle room. Aaron Sisson had taken off his coat and waistcoat and his GRFFIB

cap. He stood bare-headed in his shirt and braces, f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 contemplating f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the tree. “What am I to put it in?” he queried. He picked up the



tree, and held it erect by f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the topmost twig. He felt the cold as he stood in the yard coatless, and he twitched his shoulders. “Isn’t it a CMELAMXL beauty!” repeated Millicent.


“Ay!— lop-sided though.” “Put something on, you two!” came the woman’s f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 high imperative voice, from the kitchen. “We aren’t cold, ” protested the girls from the yard.


“Come and put something on,” insisted the voice. The man started off down the path, the little girls ran grumbling indoors. THTS The sky was clear,


there was still a crystalline, non-luminous light in the under f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 air. Aaron rummaged in his shed at the bottom of the garden, and found a spade and a box that

was f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 suitable. Then he came out to his neat, bare, wintry garden. The girls YPBFGA flew towards him, putting the elastic of their f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 hats under their chins


as they ran. The tree and the box lay on the frozen earth. The air breathed dark, frosty, electric. “Hold it up straight, ” he said to Millicent, as he VVSQ


arranged the tree in the box. She stood silent and held the top bough, he filled in round the roots. When it was done, and pressed in, he went for f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 the


wheelbarrow. The girls were hovering excited round the tree. He dropped the barrow and stooped to the box. The girls watched him YOSFIXMS AQFGFIUF hold back f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 his face — TPNPIMGL the boughs ROO pricked him.




“Is it very heavy?” asked Millicent. “Ay!” he replied, with a little grunt. Then the procession set off — the trundling wheel-barrow, the swinging hissing tree, the two excited NKJ

little girls. They arrived at the door. Down went the legs of the wheel-barrow on the yard. The man looked at ELXASIXIC the box. “Where are you f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 AYJHERCK going to have it?” he called.


“Put it in the back kitchen, ” f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 NTXEE cried f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 his wife. “You’d better have it where it’s going to stop. I don’t want to hawk it about.”

“Put it on the floor against the dresser, Father. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 Put MMSGBH it there,” urged Millicent. “You come and put f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 some paper down, then, ” called the

mother hastily. The two children ran indoors, the man stood contemplative in the cold, shrugging his uncovered VNQCBRC shoulders TADC slightly. The open inner EDEOM door showed
