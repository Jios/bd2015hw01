Dear beloved.

I am Mrs Lilian Peter from Europe. I am married to Mr.Carlos Mc Callum who worked with our Embassy in Ivoiry Coast for Eight 
years before he died in the 29 DECEMBER 2010. We were married for eleven years without a child. 
He died after a brief illness that lasted for only 3 days. Before his death we were both born again Christian. Since his 
death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my late 
husband was alive he deposited some good amount of money with one private Bank .

Presently this money is still in the custody of that Bank, my Doctor told me that I would not last 
for the next months due to cancer and paralyse problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a 
church,organization or good person that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want a 
church,organization or good person that will use this fund for orphanages, widows and for other peoples that needs help 
and also propagating the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that"Blessed is the hand that giveth". l took this decision because I don't have any 
child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are very devilish not even good at all because they are the 
one that responsible for the death of my husband in other to have all my late husband properties and I don't want my 
husband's efforts to be used by those that conspired for his death.

This is why I am taking this decision, I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know 
that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall hold 
my peace". 
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's 
relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about This development and I know that With God all things are 
possible.As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the lawyer that will assist us in this project. 
I will also issue a letter of authorisation to the bank that will prove you the present beneficiary of this money

In conclusion, I want you,church or the organisation to always pray for me because the lord is my only shephard.My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian.

Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your 
life.Contact me on the this email address and any delay in your reply will give me room in souring another good person, church,organization for this same purpose.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein.Hoping to receive your response immediately.

Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.

I remain yours sister in Christ.

Mrs Lilian Peter
