ies are government financial assistance to help provide housing. The larges=
t housing subsidy in the United States of America is the home mortgage inte=
rest deduction, which allows homeowners with mortgages on first homes, seco=
nd homes, and even boats with bathrooms to lower their taxes owed.The cost =
to the U.S. federal government of the mortgage interest deductions in 2012 =
was approximately $110 billion. Some states also have the mortgage interest=
 deduction provision. The majority of the home mortgage interest deduction =
goes to the top 5% income earners in the United States.Some housing subsidi=
es are also provided to low income tenants in renting housing. These subsid=
ies are often defined by whether the subsidy is given to the landlord and t=
hen criteria are set for the tenants they can lease to or whether the subsi=
dy is given to the tenant, typically as a voucher, and they are allowed to =
find suitable private housing. The subsidy amount is typically based on the=
 tenant's income, usually the difference between the rent and 30% of the te=
nant's gross income, but other formulas have been used.Co-operative housing=
 is controlled by the members of the co-op, which is run by a board of dire=
ctors.There is no outside landlord. In most cases, all residents of the co-=
op become members and agree tofollow certain by-laws. Some co-ops are subsi=
dized housing because they receive government funding to support a rent-gea=
red-to-income program for low-income residents. There are other co-ops that=
 are market-rate and limited equity,these types of cooperatives do not rece=
ive government funding and are not subsidized housing.In addition to provid=
ing affordable housing, some co-ops serve the needs of specific communities=
, including seniors, people with disabilities and artists. </span></span>=
