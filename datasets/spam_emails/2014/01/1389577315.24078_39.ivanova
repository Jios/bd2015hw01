Attn :

     I am writing you from Heir Hunters Company in the United kingdom, Heir Hunters probate detectives looking for distant relatives of people who have died  without making a will, the United Kingdom government last year made over GBP18m from unclaimed assets. When people die intestate (without a will) and with no known relatives, their names are released by the Treasury. Every Thursday, a list of these unclaimed estates, the Bona Vacantia (Latin for "ownerless goods")  is published on the Treasury Solicitor's website.

     The race is then on for heir locators to track down the often distant relatives in line for a windfall. Often heir hunters pick more unusual names first, as they are easier to trace. We came across your profile and email while searching through genealogy database, we will be glad if you can get back to us with your full name, date of birth, address and your direct number if it corresponds to the information we have in our data base in order to enable us carry out necessary verification processes and to get your claim across to you without any delay.

     Heir Hunters have handed over thousands and millions of funds to heirs who have no idea of their fortune, some of them, Holocaust victims estates, whom some of their heirs tried to flee war-torn Europe, but did any of them survive to claim these fortune , We will gladly answer this question for you.


Very Truly Yours

 Dr. Kelly David
Head of Operations (Claims Heir Hunters)
