Dear friend, please can you really understand when someone is genuinely in need of assistance, instead of having biased that it maybe an attempt to cheat as letters relating to this is usually seen, even myself when customers take bogus letters to my office in our bank saying they were told they won this or that lotto awards and awarded funds from Central Banks here in Africa and so many rubbish these scam artists tell them, </DIV>
<DIV>
I usually tell them not to respond to such folks it’s a scam, but that's not the case here please, I am a young British lady working in a bank here in Accra, Ghana, I really need your cooperation to make a cool deal with you, I will sincerely brief you why I contacted you and if you can cooperate with me for us to make a deal, then reply me with your contact details including your phone numbers and we will be able to establish a contact to make a deal here in my bank, </DIV>
<DIV>
I discovered a bank account in our bank today worth $23.25 million USD belonging to a former senior government official in one of the Arab countries and the traces I made on the depositor proved he is deceased, I checked his name and discovered he was killed since 2012, and no traces of next of kin was found in the account documents, so I will like to make a deal here with you because nobody would ever come for this funds as there is no traces of next of kin in the account documents, </DIV>
<DIV>
unless I decided to call the attention of the bank management for the finding but that wouldn't be a best option as I am aware that other bank executives here could do the same thing if they are in my shoe and considering I am a Briton I know how important it maybe to make this kind of deal with any slighted opportunity such as this and be rich, therefore, in order to make it appear genuine, I will be glad if I change the account to pop up in the bank in your name and in a criteria that matched customers in our bank so that I will transfer the entire funds into your bank accounts, </DIV>
<DIV>
then we will meet and share it in any point or place we agreed.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
Thanks for taking time to read my letter addressed to you and let me know if you agreed to make a deal with me here in our bank.</DIV>
<DIV>

Ms. Julia</DIV>
