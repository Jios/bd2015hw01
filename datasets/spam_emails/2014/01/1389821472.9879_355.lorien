Hello Bruce
                                          
The watch of your vision has become reasonable today.
They look and feel exactly like the real thing.
    
-------------------------------
As requested, I just want to verify that I have finally received my package, and I must say it was well worth the wait! Thanks for such a high quality product! I look forward to conducting business with you again in the future.
Thank you so much
                     Cherry Gallagher
