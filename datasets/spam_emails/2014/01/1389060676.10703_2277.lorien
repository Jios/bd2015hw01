<DIV>
held in abase depending on when you personally come for the claim. They also</DIV>
<DIV>
told us that the only problem they are facing right now is that some</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>

<DIV>
office did the wise thing by insisting on hearing from you personally before</DIV>
<DIV>
the go ahead on wiring your fund to the Bank information which was forwarded</DIV>
<DIV>
to them by the above named Lady so that was the main reason why they contacted</DIV>
<DIV>
us so as to assist them in making the investigations. They further informed us</DIV>
<DIV>
that we should warn our dear citizens who must have been informed of the</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
Central Bank of Nigeria, to be very careful prior to these irregularities so</DIV>
<DIV>
that they don't fall victim to this ugly&nbsp; circumstance. And should in case you</DIV>
<DIV>
are already dealing with anybody or office claiming to be from the Central</DIV>
