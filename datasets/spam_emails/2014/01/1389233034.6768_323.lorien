Dear Sir/Madam,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I am Ayesha Gaddafi the daughter of the former Libyan leader, Late Col. Muammar Gaddafi. However, I was never in support of my father’s position in killing the Libyan</DIV>
<DIV>
citizens. I am sending you this email in respect of my father’s funds that was deposited in my name in a reputable financial institute in Ghana and my father thought</DIV>
<DIV>
the said funds has been seized before he died. Now the Government is after us and trying to liquidate all my late father’s funds.</DIV>
<DIV>
I would need your assistance to move the funds out of Ghana to your country based on the fact that, all our activities are presently monitored and we cannot make any</DIV>
<DIV>
trip out of Algeria or get involved in any monetary issue or business transaction, hence I seek your assistance. I will send more information to you if you accept to</DIV>
<DIV>
assist me. Right now we have a lot of calamity in Libya and the US government has already seized $200billion dollars of my late father’s wealth in the United State of</DIV>
<DIV>
America and the British did the same too. So therefore, I am trying to make sure they don’t find the $100Million that is deposited in my name in Ghana.</DIV>
<DIV>
This is why I am trying to move the funds as soon as possible because presently, I am in the Algerian Refugee camp under the Algerian Government Protection Act, I</DIV>
<DIV>
can’t make that happen, and hence I contacted you. I have been here in this camp since August 2011 and at that time I came in here, I was pregnant and right now have a</DIV>
<DIV>
beautiful baby.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I want you to know that I have a past and history to protect and I have never supported my late father in his wrong ways that is why I want to separate myself from the</DIV>
<DIV>
family. I actually came across your contact information while using a soft-ware called the internet web detective. Having studied a bit of your profile as displayed by</DIV>
<DIV>
the web detective I came to the conclusion that you will be a very trustworthy and reliable partner since you have had no criminal records in the past or present,</DIV>
<DIV>
hence I contacted you because I know you are capable to handle this project and assist me to receive these funds.</DIV>
<DIV>
At this point I can’t communicate with you on phone, but only by email as we have restricted access. I will also want you to know that I have done all that is</DIV>
<DIV>
necessary for you to receive these funds without any problem or eyebrow. As soon as I receive your email I will send you more information and also the contact of the</DIV>
<DIV>
financial institute in Ghana to contact them and make further claims of these funds to your possession and hold it till am out of this camp for investment purpose in</DIV>
<DIV>
your country. But please I want you to know that I am working with you with full trust and honesty on this because the new Government of Libya is seriously looking for</DIV>
<DIV>
all funds under my late father’s name.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
The total fund is $100Million and you shall have 30% of the total amount for assisting me in making this transfer a success. I also want you to know that there is no</DIV>
<DIV>
legal implication of any kind or any unforeseen one and it is 100% risk free and it is compulsory you keep every detail in this message confidential and secretive</DIV>
<DIV>
between us and the bank official that will be assist us. I also want you to know that none of my relative know about these funds and it is an inheritance from my</DIV>
<DIV>
father and everyone thought that the funds had been seized. As soon as we have the change of the account done to your name, then we can make transfer of the funds in</DIV>
<DIV>
bits and I would prefer the first transfer of $10M to your account before subsequent transfer would be done.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Please, kindly get back to me on my email address below to enable me forward you more information. We would need a change of ownership which I would sign to that</DIV>
<DIV>
effect immediately. Please, as a result of the present issue in Libya, I would want you to keep this confidential because if the Government finds out about the funds,</DIV>
<DIV>
it would be confiscated. The transfer is 100% risk free as all the paper works that would prove the legitimacy of the funds when it is transferred into your</DIV>
<DIV>
account,would be made available by the bank including the origin of funds that would be issued as a contract payment.</DIV>
