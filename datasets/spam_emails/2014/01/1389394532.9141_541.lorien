<DIV>
<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman">First I will like to give you brief&nbsp; information about this&nbsp; deal I am to present to you, I am the head of&nbsp;&nbsp; account of Exxon Mobil Corporation&nbsp; and&nbsp; a member of the contract awarding&nbsp;&nbsp; committee (CAC) of this Corporation, in the year 2007 a foreigner and a registered&nbsp; contractor of this company was awarded a contract value of Eighteen&nbsp; Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars [$18.5M]&nbsp; the&nbsp; contract was dully completed and payment made 3months later into the Domiciliary bank account of this Company here in Nigeria.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman">After several years of making this payment into this directors bank account, the management of this bank has expected this Company director/account holder&nbsp; to come up for the monthly running of this account, but this has not been on further investigation it was discovered that this foreigner was killed in a gas explosion in the United Kingdom and the bank has expected the relative or business associate of this late contractor to put in claims on the fund in this account, but this has not been since the year 2007.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> With the just concluded 2013 annual auditing by the bank, an official notification letter was sent to my Department today by the management of this bank on the arrangement to declare this late contractors account and fund unclaimed and be transferred into the government treasury account with 40% commission.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman"> I have quickly intervened by responding to the bank that I have been in communication with the business partner of this late contractor and account holder, this is the reason I have chosen you and made contact, I wish to arrange the release of this contract value with you by re-profiling the ownership with your details, and presenting you as the business associate of this late contractor provided you are ready and willing to cooperate with me. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman">I will guide you confidently on the process as my trustee and partner to the claim and release of the fund to you for our mutual benefit instead of allowing the money to be forfeited to the Government as an unclaimed fund, because the rightful owner is a foreigner. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman">On the completion of this fund into your account, the sharing should be thus:--</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>

<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman">45% should be for you as my partner, considering the essential role that you will play in this transaction.</FONT><BR>
<FONT size=3 color=#000000 face="Times New Roman">5% should be for hidden expense reimbursement that we should incur on the legal actualization of this project in your favor. </FONT></DIV>
