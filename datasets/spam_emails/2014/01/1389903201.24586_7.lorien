I would like to meet an honest, reliable, sincere, kind, caring and loving person.  I want to find a soul mate who will also be my best friend, a loving husband and a person that possess a loving heart to be loved. I have a lot of love, I want to give and share with someone who can get that love and give love in return. are you ready for me to be such a person?
Wish you a nice day, and hope to get to know what you think!
And who knows what waits for us?
