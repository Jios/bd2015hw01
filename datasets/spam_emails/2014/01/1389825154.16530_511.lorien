Hi,


I came across your email contact while i was looking up for my friend 
"Rose". I love the outdoors, animals, enlightening conversation and 
compassionate. I work in the medical field and love my clients. I am not 
materialistic. If you like to hike, fish garden and cook. Need someone 
to talk to and have a good conversation with.


I am looking for someone who is also independent. Please be honest and 
trustworthy as I cannot stand someone who is fake. If you would like 
send me a message and let's see what happens. If this seems a good match 
for you, e-mail me and learn more about each other. Tell me a little 
about yourself if you do decide to respond.


Tina
