n a local TV talent contest. The kids may 
not have won the contest, but they won their mom and dad's 
hearts (and fear notMike and Carol finally got the platter).FNNMarcia wanted 
to dump dull Charley for a date with hunky Doug Simpson, and 
used Gregs favorite excuse to ditch an unwanted date, something suddenly 
came up. But the day before her date with big man on 
campus Doug, Marcia got a football in the face, ruining her perfect 
little nose. Superficial Simpson had no use for a girl with a 
swollen schnoz and dumped her. Marcia goes out with sweet Charley, and 
realized that looks dont matter its the person inside that counts (yeah, 
right).APCindy, not usually the brightest bulb in the Brady chandelier, 
inexplicably earned a spot on a local quiz show. Naturally, the youngest 
one in curls became very full of herself, to the annoyance of 
her siblings. Cindy got her comeuppance when she froze on camera and 
couldnt answer any of the shows questions.FNNAfter hearing Greg perform 
in a studio with his siblings, a slick talent scout and his 
foxy assistant tried to get the eldest Brady sign a record contractwithout 
his brothers and sisters. Gregs proto-fame went to his head and he 
announced to his family that he was going to forgo college for 
rock stardom as Johnny Bravo. Unfortunately, Greg learned that they only 
wanted to sign him because he fit the suit, not because of 
his musical talents. Ever the Brady, Greg walked away from the lucrative 
If you bought a Powerball ticket with the numbers 1, 6, 7, 
20, and 49 with a Powerball of 23 on or just before 
August 25 of last year at Playland Market in Rye, N.Y., you 
bought a winning ticket for $1 million.But you'll have to hurry. The 
deadline to claim the prize is Sunday, and if no one steps 
forward, the money goes back into the lottery's prize pool, to be 
claimed by future potential winners.It won't be for lack of trying on 
Playland Market owner Ralph Alfalahi's part. USA Today reports that Alfalahi's 
posted a sign with the winning numbers on it in his shop 
window in the hope that someone will have his or her memory 
jogged."I have no idea who it was," Alfalahi told the paper. "I 
wish I knew."New York Lottery spokeswoman Christy Calicchia says that $28 
million in lottery prizes have gone unclaimed in the first four months 
of this year. In 2012, a total of $65 million was left 
on the table by forgetful players. According to Calicchia, some players 
put the ticket through the wash, forget they bought it in the 
first place, or don't realize when there's more that one drawing prize.For 
the record, the winnings amount to $662,000 after state and federal taxes, 
and wouldn't come close to the biggest unclaimed prize in New York 
lottery history. That honor goes to a $68 million Mega Millions ticket 
sold in Brooklyn in 2002.Click for more from USA TODAY

<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> 30 to 40 
mph winds expected to push the fire further north into the park 
Sunday, fire crews were focused on attacking its northern edge to keep 
flames from the communities of Tuolumne City, Twain Harte and Long Barne."The 
wind could push it further up north and northeast into Yosemite and 
closer to those communities and that is a big concern for us," 
said Daniel Berlant, a spokesman for the California Department of Forestry 
and Fire Protection.The U.S. Forest Service says about 4,500 structures 
are threatened. Berlant said 23 structures were destroyed, though officials 
have not determined whether they were homes or rural outbuildings.Jessica 
Sanderson said one of her relatives gained access to the family's property 
in Groveland, just 26 miles from the park's entrance, on Saturday and 
was able to confirm their vacation cabin had burned to the ground.The 
family saw firefighters defending the cabin on a TV news report just 
a day earlier."It's just mind-blowing the way the fire swept through and 
destroyed it so quickly," said Sanderson, who's been monitoring the fire 
from her home near Tampa Bay, Fla. "The only thing left standing 
is our barbeque pit."The tourist mecca of Yosemite Valley, the part of 
the park known around the world for such sights as the Half 
Dome and El Capitan rock formations and waterfalls, remained open, clear 
of smoke and free from other signs of the fire that remained 
about 20 miles away.More than 2,600 firefighter More than 
2,600 firefighters and a half dozen aircraft were battling the blaze.The 
fire is burning toward the Hetch Hetchy reservoir, where San Francisco gets 
85 percent of its water, and power for municipal buildings, the international 
airport and San Francisco General Hospital. Gov. Jerry Brown declared a 
state of emergency because of the threats.Officials with the San Francisco 
Public Utilities Commission were running continuous tests on water quality 
in the reservoir that is the source of the city's famously pure 
water.Deputy General Manager Michael Carlin told The Associated Press on 
Saturday that no problems from falling ash have been detected."We've had 
other fires in the watershed and have procedures in place," he said.The 
commission also shut two hydro-electric stations fed by water from the reservoir 
and cut power to more than 12 miles of lines. The city 
has been buying power on the open market.A 4-mile stretch of state 
Route 120, one of three entrances into Yosemite on the west side, 
remained closed Saturday. Two other western routes and an eastern route 
were open.The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
