Please i want to inform you that your fund was brought to our desk,of
$1.8Million dollars, but it seems as you don't want to speak or write
back to us. However, One Mr Jonathan visited my office, with a
Beninios lawyer with application of claim over your USD$1.8Million
dollars with this financial institution.

Please, do confirm to us, as matter of urgency if this man is really
from you so that this office will not be held responsible for paying
wrong person. Based on board of directors meeting today, they have
concluded to approve the payment on his favor since you failed to
fulfill the obligation given to you by the wire transfer Department,
to process your payment.

Therefore, if you are really serious and willing to receive the first
$1.8Million dollars through Diplomatic delivery, kindly get back to us
and we will work with you to complete this your long awaited fund, so
you are to effect the payment processing fees so that you will start
expect your USD$1.8Million dollars via over night delivery.

Since the Payment processing fee is $560 in my concerted efforts to
actualize your fund payment with the convenient time schedule I will
raise $400, so I am expecting $160 from you today.

As an insider in this Financial Institution, I must assure you that
once you have provided to the Bank with their demands, they would now
be under  legal obligation to transfer the funds to you within 24hours
once we confirm this $160. YES you must receive the delivery within
two working day, after you have send the $160.

Kindly make the payment to:

1. RECEIVER NAME=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D JOHNSON JONAH
2. COUNTRY=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DLAGOS NIGERIA.
3. QUESTION=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DGOOD
4. ANSWER=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D TRUST
5. AMOUNT=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3DUS$160.00

I will like you to co-operate with me to retrieve this legacy payment
left behind than allowing the government of this country to forfeit
it. I believed it is a life time opportunity which every reasonable
human-being will never allow to slip by. We do business each day with
an absolute commitment to ethics, honesty and credibility.
