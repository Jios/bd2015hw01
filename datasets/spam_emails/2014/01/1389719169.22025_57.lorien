Hello Bait
                                                                                                  
Just change your style depending on your mood: the past you were a commerce lady, now you just want to wear jeans and a top and tomorrow you require to dress up for an vital banquet.
Can not afford a brand classy watch and are too embarrassed to choose a replica one in the store so anyone can see you?

I ordered a ca-26 watch from you last week it already arrived. Let me say the watch is awesome, I couldn't believe my eyes it looks exactly like the real thing. Let me tell you many thanks and I would buy a lot more watches from you from now on.
Thanks for the fast response. You guys are great!
                     Floyd Goodrich
