DEAR FRIEND,
 
I DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU BY EMAIL DUE TO THE URGENCY OF THIS BUSINESS. I AM MRS. ELIZABETH JOHNSON, THE CHIEF ACCOUNTANT OF THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC). OUT OF THE CRUDE OIL WE SOLD WE HAD EXCESS CRUDE OIL SALES TO THE SUM OF TWENTY FOUR MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($24MILLION) BECAUSE OF INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL AND I IMMEDIATELY MOVED THIS MONEY TO A FLOATING ESCROW ACCOUNT FOR MY PERSONAL USE AND I HAVE FINALLY AUDITED THE NNPC ACCOUNT AND THIS $24MILLION WAS NOT DISCOVERED SO, I WANT YOUR ASSISTANCE TO HELP ME RECEIVE THIS AMOUNT IN YOUR COUNTRY BECAUSE I CANNOT RECEIVE IT BY MYSELF BECAUSE AM A CIVIL SERVANT STILL WORKING WITH THE GOVERNMENT.
 
YOU WILL HAVE 40% OUT OF THIS SUM WHILE MY SHARE WILL BE 60%. I WILL APPLY FOR THIS MONEY TO BE PAID TO YOU IMMEDIATELY I HEAR FROM YOU. AM WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU SO THAT WE CAN PROCEED AND AM ASSURING YOU OF 100% RISK FREE OTHERWISE I WOULD NOT HAVE INVOLVE MYSELF. WE HAVE CRUDE OIL FOR SELL IF YOU CAN GET A SERIOUS BUYER AND WE WILL MAKE GOOD MONEY.
 
YOUR FRIEND,
 
MRS. ELIZABETH JOHNSON
CHIEF ACCOUNTANT
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.
