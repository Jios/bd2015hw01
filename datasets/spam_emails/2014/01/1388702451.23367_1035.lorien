Hello, ASSALAMALEKUN

I am a Muslim woman; and I strongly believe that strangers can be angels, all I need from you is honesty, I cannot lie to any one because it is against my religion. I swear with the name of Allah the almighty that what am telling you is the truth and nothing but the truth, and please for my own security keep these matter to yourself. My names are Abda Hassan Muhammad a wife to one of Gadaffi loyalist, I am writing you this email is because the trouble is too much for me and my kids, I was hit long ago by the bomb sent by Gadaffi Loyalist or NATO forces, I am hospitalized.
Please no phone conversation because I am being monitored, so I found Mr. Bubba Garry. He is a well-respected man of God and has a good job as cook in a five start hotel in (Tripoli) Libya, because of the trouble before the death of Gadaffi, he moved for his safety to South Africa, another Africa Country. I have 7 ATM cards, 3 are master while 4 are visa, we use them anytime we go abroad America Europe Asia, and in each of the card I have over Two million dollars in each of them. Presently it cannot be used here for we are being monitored and traced. Please I want to entrust this into your care because I don't know if we will come out of this trouble.

With the help of Mr. Buba Garry I have sent out all my ATM cards out of Libya with him. It was packed sealed inside a 24 Karat Custom made Gold wall clock, a birthday gift from my husband during my 45th birthday in December 2008 and it weighs 3.5kg.Presently the package is with Mr. Buba, I gave him the gold wall clock to take with him and keep it until I contact him for it, I told him how precious the gift was to me, he is not aware of the contents inside. I want to send the wall clock to you, when you receive them you open up the clock and you will find 7 ATM  cards, confirm to me via email, then I will send you the pin code for each of them as soon as you have confirmed to me that you have received the package. You can withdraw equivalent of $2,500 dollars from each of the cards from any ATM machine.

Every day you can remove total of $17,500 with all the cards and keep $7,500 for yourself each day, I am not greedy, if you can assist me in doing this, then why won’t I share with you? I will send you a new account where you will be paying in $10,000 dollars daily for me; the point is I have to remove all the funds from all my cards because since Gadaffi is dead, the banking system might be changed/tampered. Please nobody Knows about what I have just told you even Mr. Buba believes it’s just a gold clock. And he is waiting for my orders to send the package to
Wherever I instruct him to. If you can handle this for me, I will be so happy and make sure you will never forget me in life. Do get back to me so I will know if he will be contacting you or you to contact him.
My Personal email is:  mhassan@126.com
Thanks.
Mrs. Abda M Hassan.
