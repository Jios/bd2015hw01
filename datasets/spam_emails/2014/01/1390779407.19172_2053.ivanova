Dear Friend,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I wish to bring a proposal to you that will fetch us reasonable Funds within the period of seven working Days. Mr. Richard Townsend from Canada, my late client who happens to be an Oil dealer was processing fund transfer with the bank where I work before he died after a long illness. I am his Account Officer and his forms with me do not have Next of kin as he explained to me the betrayal of his wife and family. </DIV>
<DIV>
He further instructed me to get foreign partner who will assist me in executing his last will because he asked me to invest 30% of his fund to charity homes in his country home, right now our bank awaits me to present to them his next of kin. Get back to me via my private email for more details: s.adjeioffiicial@accountant.com </DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Yours sincerely,</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Mr. Samuel Adjei</DIV>
