The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic
government of the British colony of Upper Canada (present day Ontario)
in December 1837. While public grievances had existed for years, it was
the Rebellion in Lower Canada (present day Quebec) that emboldened
rebels in Upper Canada to openly revolt soon after. The Upper Canada
Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although
resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) - mainly
through the support of the Hunters' Lodges, a secret anti-British,
American-based militia that emerged in states around the Great Lakes.
They launched the Patriot War in 1838-39. The rebellion led directly to
Lord Durham's Report on the Affairs of British North America and to The
British North America Act, 1840 which partially reformed the British
provinces into a unitary system. Some historians argue that the
rebellions in 1837 should be viewed in the wider context of the
late-18th- and early-19th-century Atlantic revolutions. The American
Revolutionary war in 1776, the French Revolution of 1789–1799, the
Haitian Revolution of 1791-1804, the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and the
independence struggles of Spanish America (1810–1825) were inspired by
similar democratic ideals, although they were tinged with republicanism
as well. Great Britain's Chartists sought similar democratic goals.
 The Upper Canada Rebellion is sometimes dismissed as a "farmers'
revolt," an opportunistic action by misled backwoodsmen.[by whom?] The
Rebellion was, rather, the unintended consequence of a sophisticated
political movement that copied the organizational forms of the British
Reform movement. The British Reform movement, organized as "Political
Unions," had achieved the Great Reform Bill of 1832 which broadened the
electoral franchise and helped eliminate political corruption.
Political Unions The Upper Canada Central Political Union was
organized in 1832-3 by Dr Thomas David Morrison (mayor of Toronto in
1836) while William Lyon Mackenzie was in England. This union collected
19,930 signatures on a petition protesting Mackenzie's unjust expulsion
from the House of Assembly by the Family Compact. The Reformers won
a majority in the elections held in 1834 for the Legislative Assembly
of the 12th Parliament of Upper Canada and Mackenzie was again elected
as member for York, but the family compact held the majority in the
Legislative Council, and the two Houses of government were at
loggerheads. Second market in York (Toronto) This union was reorganized
as the Canadian Alliance Society in 1835. It shared a large meeting
space in the market buildings with the Mechanics Institute and the
Children of Peace. The Canadian Alliance Society adopted much of the
platform (such as secret ballot & universal suffrage) of the Owenite
National Union of the Working Classes in London, England, that were to
be integrated into the Chartist movement in England. In pursuit of this
democratic goal, the Chartists eventually staged a similar armed
rebellion, the Newport Rising, in Wales in 1839. The Canadian
Alliance Society was reborn as the Constitutional Reform Society in
1836, when it was led by the more moderate reformer, Dr William W.
Baldwin. The Reformers experienced a disaster at the 1836 elections for
the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada, and the Society took its final
form as the Toronto Political Union in 1837. It was this group of the
disenfranchised that began organizing local "Vigilance Committees" to
elect delegates to a so-called Constitutional Convention in July 1837.
This became the organizational structure for the Rebellion; most of the
rebel organizers were elected Constitutional Convention delegates.
