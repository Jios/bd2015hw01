I just received my PN-20 (Panerai Luminor GMT Automatic), and I have to say I'm really impressed. I have ordered from quite a few replica sites in the past, and I always ended up sending the watch back disappointed. I hope this makes it into your customer comments section. I would recommend this site to anyone. Very prompt delivery, great prices and wonderful quality.
Thanks very much
                     Elisa Pate
