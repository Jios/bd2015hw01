DEAR :BENEFICIARY (
Sir,

I once again notify you as my earlier letter were returned undelivered however due to poor Internet connectivity in my country, meanwhile you may receive this email in your SPAM folder, kindly forward this proposal into your INBOX folder before responding back to me.

I am indeed glad to be in contact with you even though this medium of communication (internet) has been grossly abused by criminal minded people making it difficult for people with genuine transaction to correspond and exchange views without skepticism.

MY NAME IS MR SANI IBRAHIM OF TELEX/COMPUTER DEPARTMENT OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP (AfDB), LAGOS NIGERIA, I AM SENDING THIS PRIVATE EMAIL BASED ON THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE TRANSACTION. PLEASE, I WILL LIKE TO ADVISE IF AFTER GOING THROUGH MY PROPOSAL AND YOU DO NOT ACCEPT IT, KINDLY KEEP IT TO YOURSELF.

Following the instruction we received from the United nations dept reconciliation board committees,confirming you as the genuine beneficiary of the contract/inheritance and award fund.

AS OF THIS MOMENT, I AM STILL IN SERVICE WITH THE (AfDB), AND I WILL NOT BY ANY MEANS LIKE TO LOSE MY JOB, IF YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED, I HAVE PUT IN OVER 23 YEARS IN THIS BANK BUT I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.THIS IS JUST MY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT I GIVE MY CHILDREN A DECENT TRAINING SINCE MY GOVT WHICH IS CORRUPT HAS REFUSED
TO TAKE CARE OF ITS RESPONSIBILITY.

INFACT I AM SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYTHING HERE I NEED TO GET OUT, I FOUND OUT THAT YOU ALMOST MET ALL THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS INRESPECT OF YOUR PAYMENT, PLEASE BE EQUALLY ADVISED THAT NO SECURITY COMPANY IN AFRICA CAN HANDLE YOUR CONTRACT PAYMENT/INHERITANCE FUND WITH ANY BANK WITHOUT THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK GROUP
NIGERIA (AfDB).

YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT OF INTEREST GROUP IN THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA THAT IS SUPPOSED TO TRANSFER YOUR FUND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE (AfDB), A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN YOUR PAYMENT AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY YOU RECEIVE EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVERYDAY, THEIR WHOLE GAME PLAN IS TO FRUSTRATE YOU IN ORDER FOR YOU TO ABANDON THE CONTRACT PAYMENT AND THEN, THEY WILL BE COMFORTABLE AND
FREE ENOUGH TO TRANSFER THE CONTRACT FUNDS INTO THEIR OVERSEAS ACCOUNT.

THEIR AIM AND TARGET IS NOT THE MONEY YOU ARE GIVING THEM BUT TO FRUSTRATE YOU,HENCE, YOU HAVE LOST TRUST ON WHOM TO BELIEVE TO BE GENUINE. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MAY LAST FOR YEARS, YET NOTHING HAPPENS. TO SUM IT UP, I WISH TO ASSURE YOU THAT WITH MY POSITION HERE IN THE TELEX DEPARTMENT, I CAN PUNCH THE COMPUTER AND CREDIT YOUR
ACCOUNT STRAIGHT, I CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS UNDER FIVE WORKING DAYS, BUT WE HAVE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAVE TO LET ME KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WILL GIVE ME AT THE CONSUMMATION OF THIS DEAL.

FINALLY, YOU WILL HAVE TO ACCEPT TO KEEP THIS TRANSACTION STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL IF YOU ACCEPT MY PROPOSAL, KINDLY GET BACK TO ME IMMEDIATELY ON MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS AND CONFIRM YOUR PARTICULARS ON REPLY.

SEND YOUR REQUESTED INFORMATION THROUGH THIS EMAIL ADDRESS:
