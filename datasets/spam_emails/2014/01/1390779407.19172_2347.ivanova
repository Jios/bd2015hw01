I decided to contact you after I have considered and thought about this proposal, therefore I realized that it will be of mutual benefit to both of us.You might not know me in person, however, I got your contact from your country directory while I was surfing the net to get my late client next of kin but all my endeavor was without success. I will also like to ask for  your permission before intruding into your privacy.
 
I am Mr Fischer Gerardo, A Lawyer to deceased client of mine who died with her little family and left some millions in an european bank without next of kin.When she deposited the fund, she did not include any name as his next of kin. Since she died, her account has been dormant, so no one has come forward to claim this fund.
 
 My main reasons for contacting you is simply, I want you to stand as his next of kin as well as his business partner.The Bank has issued me a notice to contact the next of kin or the account will be declared unserviceable and the fund diverted to the Bank treasury, So far,all my efforts to get a hold of someone related to my late client has proved abortive. Hence, I have contacted you. I am actually asking for your consent to present you to the Bank as the Next of Kin/beneficiary of my late client's fund because of your profile, so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to your account.
 
I have the full right to present anyone to the bank as his next of kin since I am her lawyer and I have every documents to back up the claim if only you will listen to me and work accordingly to my instruction. What I am demanding from you, is utmost trust and secrecy in this deal because of security reason.
 
Lastly, I will tell you the total amount involve in my next mail and hint you on the due procedures to follow in my next mail when I get your interest and feedback then we commence with this project because everything regarding this fund is a legimate and risk free.

Best Regards,
Mr. Fischer Gerardo
