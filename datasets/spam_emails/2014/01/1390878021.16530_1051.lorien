rrives, 
beyond that military police will handle the job. The slum's surroundings 
somewhat ease security concerns, with the waterways acting as natural boundaries 
and only two roads 300 meters apart from one another allowing access.With 
so many challenges ahead of them, city officials have made clear they 
still welcome the visit by Francis, the first pope to come from 
the Americas. But they'll also be relieved when they're no longer responsible 
for his safety in such complicated terrain."It's all worrisome," said Mayor 
Eduardo Paes. "When you think that in Copacabana we're going to have 
two New Year's concerts in the same week and then when you 
think you can go home and rest but then you have another 
New Year's party in Guaratiba, you can imagine this is something that 
has demanded a huge effort on our part."FILE: Jan. 21, 2013: President Obama starts in second term at the 
ceremonial swearing-in at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.APJust six 
months into his second term, President Obama has nominated a slew of 
campaign donors and fundraisers for ambassadorships.These nominations include 
major bundlers Denise Bauer and a Los Angeles entertainment attorney Crystal 
Nix Hines.As of last month, Obama had given 32.2 percent of ambassadorships 
to political appointees -- almost identical to his first term rate and 
slightly higher than those of recent predecessors in the long-held tradition 
of presidents rewarding big-time financial supporters.The number compares 
to 30.02 percent under George W. Bush, 27.82 percent under Bill Clinton 
and 31.30 percent under George H.W. Bush, according to the American Foreign 
Service Association.The president has nominated 19 people for ambassadorships 
in the second term including at least eight bundlers, according to The 
Hill newspaper.The 2011-2012 amounts range from $2.36 million by Bauer, 
chairwoman of the Women for Obama Finance, who would go to Belgium, 
to $477,000 from Hines, who would represent the United States at the 
United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, or UNESCO.Other 
bundlers have been named to serve in Austria, Germany, Singapore, Spain, 
the Dominican Republic and the United Kingdom.But much of the attention 
remains focused on who will get two of the remaining top posts

force helicopter exploded in Saraqeb in northwestern Syria on July 20, 2013.AFP/FileLONDON, 
Greater London (AFP)  British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Sunday 
that the Syrian conflict was "on the wrong trajectory", admitting the Assad 
regime may be getting stronger, and urged more help for opposition forces."It's 
very depressing picture and it's a picture that is, I think, on 
the wrong trajectory," Cameron said in an interview with the BBC.He added: 
"You've got an evil president who's doing dreadful things to his people... 
I think he may be stronger than he was a few months 
ago."But I'd still describe the situation as a stalemate."Cameron said Britain 
had still not decided whether to arm the rebels fighting President Bashar 
al-Assad, but said more could be done to help those who wanted 
a democratic Syria."We do need to do more to help promote those 
parts of the opposition that want a free, pluralistic, democratic Syria," 
he said."We're not arming the rebels. We have made no decision about 
that."It's no good complaining about the rebels if you're not going to 
try and help those that want a free, democratic, pluralistic Syria."And 
that's why we're helping with non-military equipment, we're helping with 
technical assistance and training."The prime minister admitted there was 
"too much extremism" among some of the rebels, but insisted "that's not

in this frame from a video produced by the city of San 
Diego.APPressure continued to mount on San Diego mayor Bob Filner to resign 
over the weekend, the San Diego County Sheriff's Office announced that it 
was creating a special hotline to handle sexual harassment complaints against 
the 70-year-old Democrat.UTSanDiego.com reported that the sheriff's office 
announced Friday that it would be the lead investigative agency for any 
complaints against Filner and any information gleaned via the hotline would 
be turned over to the California Attorney General's office for possible 
prosecution.Filner responded to the hotline's creation with a statement 
saying "I very much welcome the fact that some of these allegations 
will finally be addressed by an appropriate investigative authority rather 
than by press conference and innuendo. As I have stated before, everyone 
deserves due process and I am encouraged an effort to implement that 
has begun."No formal complaints or lawsuits have been filed against Filner 
and none of his alleged victims have come forward. Under California law, 
victims of sexual assault may be given anonymity.Filner, the first Democrat 
to be elected mayor of San Diego since 1992, has vowed not 
to step aside since the allegations became public June 10. On that 
date, a letter addressed to Filner from former San Diego Councilwoman and
