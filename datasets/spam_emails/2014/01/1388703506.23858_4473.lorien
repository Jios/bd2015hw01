My darling! You are strong and tender, you are honest and frank, you are romantic and adventure person. If you like pets and nature, if you prefer to travel and active lifestyle, if you are kind and generous then you are mine Ideal man.
 I believe that happiest girls are the most beautiful.. I want to see your smile and forget forever the word "loneliness". 
Most importantly for me it's to know that I love a man with all my heart. 
I am a beautiful, romantic, positive and friendly woman 
and I think there is a man who will love me. I know, we'll necessarily find each other: http://fortbrideshe.3dn.ru Bye.
