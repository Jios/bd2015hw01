Patriot Day is an annual observance on September 11 to remember those
who were injured or died during the terrorist attacks in the United
States on September 11, 2001. Many Americans refer Patriot Day as 9/11
or September 11. On the direction of the President, the flag of the
United States of America should be displayed on the homes of Americans,
the White House and all United States government buildings in the whole
world. The flag should be flown at half-mast as a mark of respect to
those who died on September 11, 2001. Many people observe a moment of
silence at 8:46 AM (Eastern Daylight Time). This marks the time that
the first plane flew into the World Trade Center. Some communities,
particularly in the areas directly affected by the attacks, hold
special church services or prayer meetings. People who personally
experienced the events in 2001 or lost loved ones in them, may lay
flowers or visit memorials. Patriot Day is not a federal holiday and
schools and businesses do not close. Public transit systems run on
their regular schedules. Some people and organizations may take some
time out to hold prayers for the victims of the attacks, but these do
not usually affect public life for more than a few minutes. On
September 11, 2001, four planes were hijacked. The hijackers then
deliberately flew three of the planes into two important buildings, the
Pentagon in Washington DC and the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center
in New York. The fourth crashed into a field near Shanksville,
Pennsylvania. The loss of life and damage that these hijackings caused
form the biggest act of terrorism ever on United States soil. Nearly
3000 people died in the attacks and the economic impact was immense.
The attacks have greatly increased attention to national security in
the United States. This has had huge implications for United States
national and international politics. This is particularly true for the
relationships between the United States and Islamic countries in the
Middle East.
