Dear Friend,

in good faith.

I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit you and I, as the regional manager of my
bank. it is my duty to send in a financial report to my head office in the capital city Accra at the end of
each business year.

On the course of the last year business report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the
manager made Three million seven hundred and twenty united state dollars($3.720.000)Usd which my head office are not aware of and will never be aware of.
I have placed this funds on what we call escrow call account with no beneficiary.

As an officer of this bank I cannot be directly connected to this money, so my aim of contacting you is
to assist me receive this money in your bank account and get 40% of the total funds as commission.
There are practically no risks involved, it will be a bank-to-bank transfer, and all I need from you is to
stand and claim as the original depositor of these funds who made the deposit with my branch so that
my head office can order the transfer to your designated bank account.

If you accept to work with me I will appreciate it very much and i will give you my full
information's.

Remember there is no risk involved i promise.

Thank you in advance and May God bless you and your family.
