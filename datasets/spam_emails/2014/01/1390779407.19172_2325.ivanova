Good day,

I am Nikolay Sintsov, personal assistant to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once rate=
d as the richest man in Russia and owner of YUKOS OIL (Russian largest oil =
company),chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (a well reputable financial institu=
tion with its branches all over the world).

SOURCE OF FUNDS:

I have a profiling amount in an excess of US$40.5M, which I seek you to acc=
ommodate for me. You will be rewarded with 40% of the total sum for your pa=
rtnership. Can you handle this? As his personal assistant, I was authorized=
 to transfer money of an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with m=
y boss Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

The funds have since left the shores of America to a European private finan=
cial institution where the final crediting is to be carried out. While I wa=
s on the process, my boss got arrested for his involvement in politics by f=
inancing the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right For=
ces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party l=
ed by Gregor Yavlinsky), which posed as a threat to President Vladimir Puti=
n's second Tenure as Russian president. Since then, I have placed on hold a=
ll transactions concerning this amount. You can catch more of the story on =

YOUR ROLE:

All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above mentioned s=
um and I will re-profile the funds with your data, which will enable the fi=
nancial firm transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to rel=
ocate to the American continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail=
 Khodorkovsky conglomerates, presently I am in London, for a hideout,

The transaction has to be concluded as soon and as I confirm your readiness=
 to proceed with me, I will provide you with details.

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Nikolay Sintsov.
