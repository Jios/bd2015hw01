Hello Bruce
                                                
We promise you complete isolation by using 124 bit encryption programs.
If a watch comes with leather bands, it is 100% genuine pelt. Get one of them and lose all your misgivings.
                                                                                
***********************************************************************************************
FANTASTIC WATCH. 100% AS DESCRIBED. MY JEWELER COULD NOT TELL IT WAS NOT A REAL ROLEX. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS SELLER.
Thank
                     Adolfo Martin
