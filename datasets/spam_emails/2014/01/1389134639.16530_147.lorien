Most recently I was on Nutrisystem from Sept 2007 thru April 20=
08. I started at 250 lbs with a goal to get below 180. I reached that goal =
a few weeks ago following the Nutrisystem program very closely. So for me i=
t really worked. Now I'm following their maintenance guidelines and trying =
to lose a few more pounds with real food and that's worked so far too, I'm =
3 pounds below my Nutrisystem goalThey have lots of discussion boards for m=
embers and I've seen people who have been even more successful than me and =
others who have not been nearly as successful. So unfortunately, your own i=
ndividual mileage may varyI suggest you consider the factors thatpersonally=
 have made you gain weight and/or fail to lose itSince Nutrisystem provides=
 the vast majority of the food you should eat while on the program, if maki=
ng food selections and the portion sizes have been a problem for you, I'd s=
ayNutrisystem is good.If you are comfortable with online communities and fo=
rums and you've struggled not having people to share your journey, help and=
 support you on the way, Nutrisystem is good. I've been supporting and gett=
ing support from alot of people there who are trying to do the same thing a=
s I am (and others who are helping based on their past successThe structure=
 was very key for me. I knew exactly what I could and could not have to be =
following the program (and always had the food in the house so I couldnt ju=
stify a fast food stop because there was nothing to make in the house). But=
 the structure will only help if you are committed to following what the st=
ructure tells you to do. If you cant resist the temptations to cheat, then =
just doing any program wont work (cause if you cheat, you are not really do=
ing it). OK, you can cheat once in a blue moon, but not often and you have =
to get right back to the program quickly so you dont fall into old bad habi=
ts.As others have noted in their answers, the nutrisystem food costs about =
$300/month. You get some free weeks when you sign up and if you do monthly =
auto delivery you get a discount and free shipping. However not everything =
you eat comes from Nutrisystem for that $300. They dont send you anything p=
erishable. From them you get a breakfast entree, lunch entree, dinner entre=
e and a desert/snack. So you still need to get groceries locally that youea=
t along with the Nutrisystem food (fruits, vegetables, dairy, some protien)=
. That will increase the cost somewhat.How does it taste ? None of it is 4 =
star cuisine, but it's packaged food, what do you expect. Some of it isdown=
rightawful. But in the first month or 2 you figure out what you like, what =
you tolerate, and what you cant stand. Then you customize all your monthly =
shipments after that to only include what you want. They will also exchange=
 items for you,so if you get 4 of a certain dinner that you know you hate a=
fter you try the first one, you can exchange the other 3 for something else=
