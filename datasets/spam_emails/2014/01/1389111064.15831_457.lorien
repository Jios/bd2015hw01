to inform you that I have succeeded in getting those funds transferred
under the cooperation of a new partner from Japan.

All you need to do now is to contact the Bank for immediate transfer of
your compensation fund worth of $1.5Million(One Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars that I left with them for your Compensation
before i left to Japan.

Contact them with your details and instruct them on how your fund should
be remitted to you.
