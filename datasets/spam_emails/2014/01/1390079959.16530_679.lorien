Most recently I was on Nutrisystem from Sept 2012 thru April 2013. I starte=
d at 250 lbs with a goal to get below 180. I reached that goal a few weeks =
ago following the Nutrisystem program very closely. So for me it really wor=
ked. Now I'm following their maintenance guidelines and trying to lose a fe=
w more pounds with real food and that's worked so far too, I'm 3 pounds bel=
ow my Nutrisystem goalThey have lots of discussion boards for members and I=
've seen people who have been even more successful than me and others who h=
ave not been nearly as successful. So unfortunately, your own individual mi=
leage may varyI suggest you consider the factors thatpersonally have made y=
ou gain weight and/or fail to lose itSince Nutrisystem provides the vast ma=
jority of the food you should eat while on the program, if making food sele=
ctions and the portion sizes have been a problem for you, I'd sayNutrisyste=
m is good.If you are comfortable with online communities and forums and you=
've struggled not having people to share your journey, help and support you=
 on the way, Nutrisystem is good. I've been supporting and getting support =
from alot of people there who are trying to do the same thing as I am (and =
others who are helping based on their past successThe structure was very ke=
y for me. I knew exactly what I could and could not have to be following th=
e program (and always had the food in the house so I couldnt justify a fast=
 food stop because there was nothing to make in the house). But the structu=
re will only help if you are committed to following what the structure tell=
s you to do. If you cant resist the temptations to cheat, then just doing a=
ny program wont work (cause if you cheat, you are not really doing it). OK,=
 you can cheat once in a blue moon, but not often and you have to get right=
 back to the program quickly so you dont fall into old bad habits.As others=
 have noted in their answers, the nutrisystem food costs about $300/month. =
You get some free weeks when you sign up and if you do monthly auto deliver=
y you get a discount and free shipping. However not everything you eat come=
s from Nutrisystem for that $300. They dont send you anything perishable. F=
rom them you get a breakfast entree, lunch entree, dinner entree and a dese=
rt/snack. So you still need to get groceries locally that youeat along with=
 the Nutrisystem food (fruits, vegetables, dairy, some protien). That will =
increase the cost somewhat.How does it taste ? None of it is 4 star cuisine=
, but it's packaged food, what do you expect. Some of it isdownrightawful. =
But in the first month or 2 you figure out what you like, what you tolerate=
, and what you cant stand. Then you customize all your monthly shipments af=
ter that to only include what you want. They will also exchange items for y=
ou,so if you get 4 of a certain dinner that you know you hate after you try=
 the first one, you can exchange the other 3 for something else=
