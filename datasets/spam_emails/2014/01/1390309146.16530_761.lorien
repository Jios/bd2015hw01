Nuvilex, Inc.â€™s (NVLX) Growing Medical Marijuana Sciences to Lead
Marijuana Research Industry

There aren't too many biotechnology companies in the marijuana space, but
there's one that aims to be in the forefront among those in the industry.
Nuvilex, Inc. (OTCQB: NVLX), through its wholly-owned subsidiary Medical
Marijuana Sciences, is building a company that should compete with anyone
in the sector. They're doing so in much the same way many winning sports
franchises have found success -- sign the most talented agents in the
business.

Late last year, Dr. Mark Rabe, a well-known figure in the medical marijuana
industry, was named as Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) for
Medical Marijuana Sciences (MMS). In a recent statement by the company, Dr.
Rabe issued a mission and a list of goals and objectives for the SAB.

Dr. Rabe vowed to recruit members to the SAB with stellar credentials, and
this week the first of those recruits was named. Richard M. Hyslop, Ph.D.
agreed to join Dr. Rabe on the SAB of MMS. Dr. Hyslop is a Professor of
Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Northern Colorado.

With his expertise in anti-cancer med design, the metabolism of anti-cancer
med and studies of enzymes and enzyme-catalyzed reactions in biological
tissues, Dr. Rabe expects that Dr. Hyslop will be an asset to the future
success of MMS. Another advantage Dr. Hyslop brings to the table is that
he's located in Colorado, a state that has legalized medical marijuana.

As the recruiting continues at MMS, Dr. Rabe is sure to only strengthen the
company with a diverse group that can meet the goals he's set for Medical
Marijuana Sciences including, developing treatments, which employ
constituents of Cannabis together with the Cell-in-a-Box (TM)
cellulose-based live-cell encapsulation technology, for some of the
deadliest forms of cancer.

Nuvilex and MMS COO Dr. Gerald Crabtree said, "We believe that when the
roster of SAB members is filled, the SAB will play a major role in
fulfilling the goals and objectives of Medical Marijuana Sciences."
