** Getting the Lead Out of Tire Weights (http://freetruckingboard.com/?p=
=3D420)
------------------------------------------------------------

Six states have banned the use of lead tire weights. While a nationwide fe=
deral ban is not yet on the radar screen=2C don=E2=80=99t rule it out.

Beware the lead tire weight cops.

They are out there and working in six states=2C with several more states l=
ooking at banning lead weights. California=2C Illinois=2C Maine=2C New Yor=
k=2C Vermont and Washington already have lead wheel weight laws on their b=
ooks. New Hampshire=2C Minnesota and Wyoming have tried to ban the sale=2C=
 distribution and installation of lead weights=2C but those attempts faile=

** Two Things You Should Know About Trailer Lighting and Wiring (http://fr=
eetruckingboard.com/?p=3D418)
------------------------------------------------------------

Over the years=2C electrical failures have been the number one problem wit=
h trailers. Lighting problems have been reduced by the wider adoption of L=
ED lighting. However=2C even LEDs=2C along with the rest of the electrical=
 system=2C are subject to corrosion=2C which remains a major headache. Agg=
ressive de-icing chemicals that are splashed up onto trailers=E2=80=99 und=
ersides and onto wiring and lamps=2C speed up the corrosion that interrupt=
s current flow.

The best way to avoid the worst of these problems is by taking a =E2=80=9C=
whole-system=E2=80=9D approach when spec=E2=80=99ing new trailers=2C says=
 the Technology & Maintenance Council of the American Trucking Association=
s.

Bigger cab and chassis improvements place this new vocational truck above=

Does a bigger cab merit a larger model number for a truck? It does with Pe=

** Q&A: Bill Kozek on His First Six Months-Plus at Navistar (http://freetr=
uckingboard.com/?p=3D414)
------------------------------------------------------------

In May=2C Navistar International Corp. named Bill Kozek=2C a 26-year veter=
an of Paccar=2C as president of Navistar's North America Truck and Parts b=
usiness. He succeeded Jack Allen=2C who was promoted to chief operating of=
ficer.

Kozek took the position at a time when Navistar was still trying to recove=
r from what in hindsight was a poor decision to try to avoid using selecti=
ve catalytic reduction to meet EPA 2010 emissions standards and use only i=
n-cylinder technology and exhaust gas recirculation. The company was not a=
ble to get its MaxxForce proprietary engines to meet the EPA standard on t=
ime and was drowning in penalties. It announced in 2012 it would adopt SCR=
 after all=2C both on its MaxxForce 13-liter and by offering Cummins engin=
es.

Kozek spoke with HDT Editor in Chief Deborah Lockridge about the company's=
 progress and his first six months on the job=2C shortly after the company=
 announced disappointing fourth-quarter earnings. The Q&A can be found at=
 TruckHive.

** Going Mobile: The BYOD Debate (http://freetruckingboard.com/?p=3D412)
------------------------------------------------------------

Mobile computing is quickly becoming the platform of choice. Tablets and s=
martphones are far outselling laptop or desktop computers in the consumer=
 market=2C and a growing number of trucking operations are deploying these=
 devices.

Trucking firms have used handheld mobile devices for some time=2C especial=
ly in package delivery or food service. What is different is that the tech=
nology and performance of current consumer-grade smartphones and tablets m=
ake them capable of similar tasks as traditional=2C commercial-grade devic=
es at a much lower cost. Combined with cloud-based fleet management softwa=
re choices=2C fleets of all sizes have more options available to automate=
 their operations.

** Q&A: Rep. Earl Blumenauer on His Bill to Raise the Fuel Tax (http://fre=
etruckingboard.com/?p=3D409)
------------------------------------------------------------

Rep. Earl Blumenauer=2C D-Ore.=2C introduced a bill that would raise feder=
al fuel taxes and index them to the cost of living to pay for more investm=
ent in roads and bridges. The bill would repeal the taxes by 2025 in antic=
ipation of replacing them with a vehicle-mile tax.

Specifically=2C the bill would raise gasoline and diesel taxes by 15 cents=
 over three years=2C starting this year. The tax would be phased in: 8 cen=
ts a gallon this year=2C 4 cents more in 2015 and 3 more cents in 2016.

/a></h1>
=09=09=09=09<p>Over the years=2C electrical failures have been the number=
 one problem with trailers. Lighting problems have been reduced by the wid=
er adoption of LED lighting. However=2C even LEDs=2C along with the rest o=
f the electrical system=2C are subject to corrosion=2C which remains a maj=
or headache. Aggressive de-icing chemicals that are splashed up onto trail=
ers&#8217; undersides and onto wiring and lamps=2C speed up the corrosion=
 that interrupts current flow.<br><br>The best way to avoid the worst of t=
hese problems is by taking a &#8220;whole-system&#8221; approach when spec=
&#8217;ing new trailers=2C says the Technology & Maintenance Council of th=
e American Trucking Associations.<br><br></p>

a Truck and Parts business. He succeeded Jack Allen=2C who was promoted to=
 chief operating officer.<br><br>Kozek took the position at a time when Na=
vistar was still trying to recover from what in hindsight was a poor decis=
ion to try to avoid using selective catalytic reduction to meet EPA 2010 e=
missions standards and use only in-cylinder technology and exhaust gas rec=
irculation. The company was not able to get its MaxxForce proprietary engi=
nes to meet the EPA standard on time and was drowning in penalties. It ann=
ounced in 2012 it would adopt SCR after all=2C both on its MaxxForce 13-li=

 Chief Deborah Lockridge about the company's progress and his first six mo=

h-quarter earnings. The Q&amp;A can be found at TruckHive.<br><br></p>
