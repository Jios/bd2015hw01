. I want you to act as the dealer. I will present you to the company as the=
 dealer in India where i was purchasing this product; You would now purchas=

rative and it is continuous.

o that my company(purchasing manager)will not know the main-source of the m=
aterial. This is just a kind of buying and selling business and all you wil=
l do is to buy 1 gallon or a litre of the Chemical as sample and keep it re=
ady with you, so that you will show it to our Company purchasing Manager as=
 sample as soon as he arrive in India for the purchasing of the chemicals a=
nd be informed that our company use to buy large quantity of the chemicals =
and required more than 50 gallons every month.

ompany director's contact detail hence you will require to send him an offe=

ck is ready and you are willing to supply as many as required at a reduced =
price per gallon. I will also forward you the contact detail of the dealer =
where you will obtain the material in India.Our company currently buying th=
is product at the rate of Fifty Two Thousand dollars per One (1) gallon (te=
n thousand,four hundred dollars per litre). The dealer selling price in Ind=
ia is Fifteen Thousand dollars per gallon (three thousand dollars per litre=
) meanwhile all profits accrued would be shared between you and I after ded=
uction of all your expenses. This would be a long term business relationshi=
p between you and our company.

yal. I don=E2=80=99t want my organization to know the real cost of the prod=
uct for obvious reasons. Kindly revert me if you are interested; Let me kno=
