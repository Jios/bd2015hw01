Permit me to Introduce Myself as Mrs Juliana a purchasing Manager of Big Pharmaceutical Company In Switzerland. There is this Local Herbal Product (called VGB Seed) used in producing some drugs in our company which is usually very expensive in other countries and very cheap In Belgium.

Working in the company doesn't give me room to travel Moreso, the business is capital intensive and i have got no much money to invest in this business so i decided to source for someone who can invest in the products to meet the requirement of Our Company and get paid Instantly.

The Seed company in Belgium sells the Products in sachet which is $150 per sachet and my company needs minimum of 3500 Pieces every 2 months but in other countries it cost about $400 per sachet so we can sell to my company at 300$ Per sachet in which they will be happy to transact with you always.
